# Measuring Inflation
**Inflation**: Average increase in **prices** across the economy
**Price Index**: Measure of average prices during a particular interval of time defined relative to a base period
- Defined to be 100 in the base period 
- Value in other period reflect average prices **relative** to base period
## Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- Most common price index used for measuring inflation
- Measure of average prices for **consumer goods**
	- Reflects cost of consumption for average household (COL)
- Constructed by Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
	- Choose a **basket of goods and services** that reflects consumption habits of average household using extensive survey of household consumption
	- Go to stores every month and record prices of goods and services in the CPI basket
	- Calculate the cost of the CPI basket relative to its cost in the bast period
	- Do all this to ensure not just a change in change of consumer tastes (items/quantity) and thus change basket
$$
CPI = \frac{\text{Cost of consumption bakset using target period prices}}{\text{Cost of consumption basket using base period prices}} \times 100
$$
- Multiply by 100 to scale it to the base period (Fraction gives ratio, multiplying by 100 gives the CPI)
Note: Consumption basket defined as the set of goods and services consumed in the **base period**
- We can set any year as the base period; **inflation is a measure relative measure**
- Don't care about quantity with simple economy in one good; Measure in relation to base quantity (Quantity would get divided -> Drop, so we just compare prices)
Total spending increase would then be price times quantity of both -> Not the CPI, as spending cares about quantity in different periods v. CPI cares about quantity in base period
- CPI is closer to the CPI of the good with larger share; contributes more to the weighted average
## From CPI to Inflation
- Inflation is rate of change of the CPI
$$
\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{CPI' - CPI}{CPI} = \frac{CPI'}{CPI} - 1
$$
## Caveats to Measuring Inflation
- CPI only focuses on prices for the average household, excludes many goods and services
	- Government expenditures and purchases by firms not included; just care about households
- Inflation is an average, but different households will experience the same rate of inflation differently
	- Most people do not consume exactly like the basket; some people it will be worse, some people it will be better
- Government statisticians use sophisticated techniques to adjust CPI for new goods and quality improvements, but these adjustments are imperfect
	- Inflation calculation is slower than rate of technology
# Real and Nominal Quantities
## Real v. Nominal GDP
**GDP**: Market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given time period
- If all prices double, GDP doubles, if output is same amount
Is growth in GDP due to:
- More goods and services being produced?
- Prices for goods and services increasing?
**Nominal GDP**: The total market value of production using **current** market prices
**Real GDP**: Strips out fluctuations due to changing prices to focus on measuring quantity
- More meaningful measure of wellbeing (GDP still has flaws)
## Converting Nominal to Real
- Nominal GDP grows by $x\%$ and inflation is $y\%$
- How fast does real GDP grow:
- Subtract the inflation: $(x - y )\%$
$$
\text{Real Growth} = \text{Nominal Growth} - \text{Inflation}
$$
- Same method can be used to adjust growth in any nominal variable for inflation
- Approximation; works with small numbers
## Converting Nominal to Real (Levels)
$$
V' = \frac{PI'}{PI} \times V
$$
## Revisit Real GDP
- Real GDP is just nominal GDP expressed in a different year's dollars
- General Formula:
$$
\text{Real GDP} = \frac{\text{Price index in base year}}{\text{Price index in current year}} \times \text{Nominal GDP}
$$
If Price Index uses same base year as real GDP:
$$
\text{Real GDP} = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Price Index}} \times 100
$$
