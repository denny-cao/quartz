# What is the Central Bank?
Central bank is the government institution that:
- Supervises and regulates systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs; especially banks)
- Controls short-run interest rates (US federal funds rate)
- Influences long-run interest rates
- Acts as a lender of last resort
These activities jointly comprise monetary policy
US: Federal Reserve Bank or the Fed
## "Dual" Mandate of the Fed: Maximum Employment and Stable Prices
- **Employment Act of 1946**: Instructs federal government to "promote **maximum employment**, production, and **purchasing power**."
- **Federal Reserve Act**: "Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of **maximum employment**, **stable prices**, and moderate long-term interest rates."
- **Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act**:

- Maximum employment rate: 4-4.5% (for the US)

- Not generally a partisan job (Pattern broken from Trump)
## Governance in Central Banks
- In the US, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has 12 voting members; 7 "Governors" of the Federal Reserve Board, appointed by the President (confirmed by Senate) and 5 regional Federal Reserve Bank Presidents
## Global trend toward greater central bank independence from political influence
- **Traditional Motivation**: Prevent politicians from dictating an overly short-sighted execution of monetary policy
	- If monetary policy were dictated by elected officials, monetary policy might be too expansionary, particularly in the run-up to elections, helping the economy in the short-run but hurting it with too much inflation in the long-run
- Related motivation: Technocratic expertise

## Setting the short-term interest rate
- Fed's key policy interest rate: Federal funds rate
- **Federal funds rate**: Interest rate private banks **pay each other** when they borrow reserves **from each other** (held on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank)
	- Overnight rate, but often annualized (For overnight loans)
	- Protection for large outflow of withdraws 
	- Borrow when short on reserves

### FOMC Statements
**January 27, 2021**: Unsure of economy, so kept Federal funds rate as low as possible, from 0 to 0.25%
- Worried about economy going into stall/crash so lower interest rate to encourage people to borrow and spend
**February 1, 2023**: Economy is doing well, unemployment below 4%, but a lot of inflation
- Raise target range to 4.5 to 4.75%; economy is too hot
### Controlling the Federal Funds Rate
- Federal Reserve pays interest on reserves (IOR)
- IOR is 5.4% as of 2/14/2024
- Recall that reserves are like "deposits" that a bank has at the Fed
- Banks can borrow from each other (short-term) by paying a minuscule amount more than 5.4% interest (because other banks are getting that much interest from the Fed and are happy to make loans for a bit more interest)
	- IOR pins down interest rate for banks; get really close to 5.4% by talking to multiple banks (counterparties)
### Setting the federal funds rate by changing IOR
- The central  bank raises or lowers the level of **interest on reserves (IOR)**
### Consequences of changing IOR
- Lower IOR: Federal funds rate falls
- Raise IOR: Federal funds rate rises
- IOR and federal funds rate track each other almost perfectly 
### Short-term interest rates v. long-term interest rates
- Federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate
- Most major borrowing decisions are based on long-term interest rates (ex. 10 year rates)
- Federal funds rate is an input to the long-term interest rate
- Can think of 10-year interest rate as a train of short-term interest rates
	- First train car: Federal funds rate that clears the federal funds market today
	- Last train-car is the expectation of federal funds rate that will clear the federal funds market in 10-years time
## Influencing the long-term interest rate
## Asset Pricing Equation
Price of a stock is discounted value of future dividends, discounting by interest rate
$$
P = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{D(1+g)^{j-1}}{(1+i)^j} = \frac{D}{i-g}
$$
Bonds: No growth rate
$$
P = \frac{\text{coupon}}{i-0}=\frac{\text{coupon}}{i}
$$
$$
i = \frac{\text{coupon}}{P}
$$
## Consequences of buying or selling bonds
- When Fed buys Treasury securities and agency MBS, the Fed lowers long-run interest rates:
	- By raising the price of Treasuries/MBS, and therefore lowering the interest rate
- When the Fed sells Treasury securities and agency MBS, the Fed raises long-run interest rates:
	- By lowering the price of Treasuries/MBS, and therefore raising the interest rate
## (Agency) Mortgage-Backed Securities
- Agency MBS, are securities created by pooling mortgages and then creating securities that each represent a claim to a fraction (ex. 1/10,000) of the total diversified pool of mortgages
- The securities jointly receive the interest and principal payments from that pool
- The pooling is done by government sponsored enterprises ("agencies"), especially Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae
## How do these "open market operations" affect quantity of reserves?
- When Fed expands (or contracts) the quantity of reserves, this is referred to as an **open market transaction**
## By increasing quantity of reserves, the Fed does not:
- "Give banks a bailout" or "give banks money"
- "Print money"
- Fed is receiving securities from private banks and paying for them with (electronic) reserves held at the Fed
- Money supply (M2) is "currency in circulation, checking accounts, saving accounts, and most other types of (highly liquid) bank accounts"
- A bank's reserves held at the Fed are not part of M2 so they are not what we call "money' (and they are therefore not necessarily inflationary)
- From 2008-2014, the Fed increased reserves from $10 billion to $3 trillion and inflation stayed at 2%
## Quantitative Easing (QE) v. Quantitative Tightening (QT)
- QE: Fed buys Treasuries (and MBS) and pays by giving banks reserves held on deposit at the Fed
	- So bank reserves held on deposit at Fed go up
- QT: Fed sells Treasuries (and MBS) and take payment in the form of bank reserves held on deposit at the Fed
	- So bank reserves held on deposit at Fed go down
