# Facts About Economic Growth
## World barely grew until 1800 but it has taken off since around 1800
![[Pasted image 20240413145230.png]]
- Global economy expanded during Malthusian Period, but population did as well

## Regions have diverged

## Sustained Growth: Dominated fluctuations in the US & other "Frontier economies"
![[Pasted image 20240413145527.png]]
- Frontier economies: Do not adopt other technologies, as they are ahead of others; can only grow by innovating
![[Pasted image 20240413145749.png]]
- Each half century the economy has generally grown at relatively similar rates, which means adding more to per capita income
- If the economy grows at a steady 2% rate, then when per capita GDP is $1,000 it will add $20 and when it is $50,000 it will add $1,000.

# Understanding Saving, Investment, and Capital Accumulation
## Capital (K) has grown over time
![[Pasted image 20240413151725.png]]
## Capital intensity (K/L) has also grown while K/Y has been roughly constant 
![[Pasted image 20240413152009.png]]
## Capital is a stock, investment is a flow
![[Pasted image 20240413152048.png]]
- Pour more investment into glass, flow out of straw (depreciation)
- Difference between new investment and old capital flowing out is capital stock
## Understanding how capital accumulates
Capital is a stock that is measured at a point in time and investment is a flow that is measured over a period
$$
K_{t+1} = K_t + I_t - \text{Depreciation}_t
$$
Where $K_{2022}$ (for example) is amount of capital at the **beginning** of 2022. This capital is used for production during the year 2022 ($Y_{2022}$). Investment and depreciation during 2022 result in a new amount of capital $K_{2023}$ at the beginning of 2023.

## Sources of investment
From the two key international identities: 
$$
I \equiv S - NX
$$
$$
I \equiv S + \text{Foreign capital flows}
$$
## REMINDER: Closed economy, $Y = C + I$
In a closed economy, farmer eats four bushels of wheat ($C = 4$). Then save other 2 bundles ($S = 6 - 4$). This saving is planted to make future wheat ($I = 2$). Thus, $S \equiv I$ in closed economy.
## REMINDER: Open economy with trade deficit, $Y = C + I + (X-M)$
In this case, economy uses more than it produces for consumption ($C=4$) and investment ($I = 3$). It does this by getting one bushel of wheat from abroad through imports ($NX = -1$).
## In practice, most investment is funded by domestic saving not foreign capital

# Growth Accounting & the Growth Slowdown
## One big issue across all the advanced economies: growth has slowed, will it continue?
![[Pasted image 20240413161229.png]]
## Growth accounting (which is "development accounting" over time)
$$
\text{Labor Productivity Growth} \approx \text{Total Factor Productivity Growth} + \frac{1}{3}(\text{Growth of capital intensity}) + \frac{2}{3}(\text{Growth in average human capital})
$$
## Sources of US labor productivity growth
![[Pasted image 20240413161839.png]]
- 1948-1973: Interstate highway system built, automobiles mass items, shape of country (suburbs and cities) changed, manufacturing productivity improved a lot, R&D and innovation that went into WW2 commercialized
- Human capital is same between periods
- Growth has had ups and downs due to total factor productivity
- 1995-2005: Internet + Phones, etc.
## Total factor productivity growth has slowed in all of the large advanced economies

## How to square with the data as we read about extraordinary innovations w/AI?
## Hypothesis: Takes time to incorporate new innovations
- When generation of electricity invented, not next day economic growth happened. Power lines, new innovations that took advantage, change factory structure
- Lag between innovation and use
- Computers: Improved a lot, but didn't change economy a lot until later
- AI: Possible lowering productivity growth; business, hire 100 people to figure out how to use AI to better run business, and did not implement solution -> No increase in output, but higher labor... May eventually become added in the future but will take time to learn how to use and deploy
## Alternative Hypothesis: Ideas harder to find 
- Important things in agriculture already mechanized and efficient, and only also crop that all technology went into (strawberries) -> Inputs to innovate become harder and harder over time and output won't be as much in terms of GDP
	- Easier to make initial progress than last stretch
# Convergence
## Growth in Portugal and the US
![[Pasted image 20240413174815.png]]
## Economic Growth in OECD economies: 1960-2019
![[Pasted image 20240413174912.png]]
- Poorer you are, faster growth will be (Absolute convergence)
$$
\text{Growth}_{i} = f\left(\frac{Y_i}{L_i}\right)
$$
- Lower the per capita income of economy $i$ the faster its growth rate
- This implies that eventually all economies will have the same incomes because poorer economies will catch up to richer ones
- Two sources of convergence:
	- Diminishing returns to capital, as you accumulate more it adds less
	- Poorer countries can adopt ideas from richer ones
- Empirically convergence is about 2% annually---that is a poor country goes 2% of the way to the frontier economy
## Illustration of 2% annual convergence

## More examples of convergence: The experience of US states
![[Pasted image 20240413175507.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240413175619.png]]
- Works well for OECD, but for global, this relationship goes away from 1960-1995
- LOBF is upwards sloping
![[Pasted image 20240413180609.png]]
- Now Nigeria doing better than predicted
![[Pasted image 20240413180655.png]]
- Declining global economy
- Globalization benefitting low income countries
- Why switch?
	- Convergence is force pushing you up, but you may be doing things that are undoing it (Bad policies, etc.)
	- Past: Unbalanced macroeconomic policies, restrictions to trade, less openness to investment, etc.
	- Potential to take advantage of convergence had policies that got in way of it
## Convergence and its limits
Convergence model works well for similar countries (or states) with similar institutions and policies
But:
- Huge divergence from about 1000 to 2000
- Convergence in more recent decades
- Many countries have done much worse or much better than convergence would lead you to believe
## If China's growth follows convergence it will slow over time as returns to capital diminish

## Same graph but shown in growth rates
![[Pasted image 20240413181145.png]]
## Even with convergence, Mozambique will be very far behind for a very long time
