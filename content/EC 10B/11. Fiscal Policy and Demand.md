# Discretionary Fiscal Policy in the Short Run
## Long-run spending and tax policies (not the subject of this class)
Spending and tax policy can affect the supply side of the economy, expanding its potential and increasing the level/growth rate over the longer run

Examples:
- Public research and development could raise technology (A)
- Corporate tax reform could increase the capital stock (K)
- Increasing educational spending could raise human capital (H)

We will focus on what the policies do immediately to capital and labor utilization, not their longer-run supply-side effects. For this purpose, digging holes and refilling them is equivalent to building a much-needed bridge
## Fiscal Policy
Changing spending or taxes to have a **short-run** impact on the **demand-side** of the economy.
- Often with a countercyclical motivation

Example: Increasing G can increase Y
## Reminder: Demand: Output or Inflation?
Nominal Demand:
$$
Y \times P \equiv C \times P_C + I \times P_I + G \times P_G + (X\times P_X - M \times P_M)
$$
Supply:
$$
Y \equiv A \times F (K,L)
$$
If demand goes up a lot but supply does not, (e.g because the economy is already at capacity) then get more inflation not more output
## Direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy
$$
Y = C(Y - T, r) + I(Y, r) + G + (X-M)
$$
- Government raises purchases (e.g. builds more roads)
$$
Y\uparrow = C(Y - T, r) + I(Y,r) + G\uparrow + (X-M)
$$
- Government cuts taxes or increases transfers
$$
Y\uparrow = C\uparrow(Y-T\downarrow,r) + I(Y,r) + G + (X-M)
$$
## Fiscal Policy Multiplier also reflects indirect effects
$$
\text{Fiscal Policy Multiplier} = \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta G} = \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta T}
$$
Multiplier may differ from 1 because of two **indirect effects**:
- **Traditional Keynesian Multiplier** (Depends on composition of tax cut/purchases)
- **Crowding Out** (Depends on choices of central bank and the state of the economy)
## Indirect Effect 1: Traditional Keynesian Multiplier amplifies shocks, including fiscal

## What types of policies have higher traditional Keynesian multipliers?
- **Money for households with a higher marginal propensity to consume**
	- Lower-income
	- Temporarily lower income and wants to smooth consumption (e.g. unemployed)
- **Loans and loan-like policies for businesses with temporary liquidity needs**
- **Money that spends out more quickly** (e.g. infrastructure spending can take years)
## Indirect Effect 2: Crowding Out
![[Pasted image 20240304153657.png]]
- Government borrows $100 billion to pay for road sand bridges (So $G$ goes up $100 billion)
- Drives up interest rates, so businesses cut back their investment and homebuilding by $60 billion (so $I$ down $60 billion)
- Overall demand is up $40 billion (not counting the traditional Keynesian multiplier)
## Degree of crowding out depends on the central bank's choices
The central bank could choose to:
- **Keep interest rates from rising** (no crowd out, high multiplier)
	- Utilize monetary expansion to shift supply out to keep interest rate the same
	- ![[Pasted image 20240304154332.png]]

- **Allow interest rates to rise naturally** (partial crowd out, medium multiplier)
- **Deliberately raise interest rates even more to fully offset the fiscal expansion** (complete crowd out, zero multiplier)

## Summary of Discretionary fiscal policy
Direct Effect: Expansion increases $Y$

Indirect Effects:
- Traditional Keynesian multiplier: Augments the effect, the magnitude depends on the exact policy
- Crowding out: Can dampen the effect but depends on how the central bank responds

When the economy is well below potential with zero interest rates, fiscal policy can be especially effective and monetary policy can be especially constrained

## Why unlimited fiscal expansions cannot be used to make unlimited output increases
- **May increase inflation instead of real output, especially if the economy is at its potential**. The same analysis as with monetary policy; fiscal policy is about demand increases which will be a combination of $Y$ and $P$, which the ratios depending on the state of the economy
- **The central bank likely to offset what it perceives as undesired fiscal policy**. This is because of the central bank's inflation objective ("Full crowd out")
- **Costs of deficits/debt**. 
# Automatic Stabilizers
When the economy weakens, taxes automatically go down and spending (e.g unemployment insurance benefits) automatically goes up

Examples:
- If family income falls, tax payments fall
- If family income falls, may become eligible for government benefits for low-income households
- If worker loses job, gets unemployment insurance
## What would make automatic stabilizers larger?
- Higher taxes and spending as a share of the economy
- More progressive taxes/spending
- More programs that trigger based on macroeconomic conditions

# Four Debates About Countercyclical Policy
## Summary of the use of countercyclical policy
- Monetary and fiscal policy can be used to offset shocks that reduce (or increase) aggregate demand; moving the economy more rapidly back to full employment than it would move by itself
	- Major types of shocks: Real (i.e. technology), Keynesian (i.e. animal spirits), financial and monetary, or global
- Cannot be used to sustainably increase the growth rate in an economy at potential (at full employment). Instead, you would get inflation and/or crowding out of investment
