# Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) Relationship
$$
(1+i) = \left(\frac{e}{e^\text{expected}}\right)(i + i^\text{foreign})
$$
Assuming:
- No risk (or strictly, no risk differences)
- Investors move money based on profit maximization
- Investors can freely move money (arbitrage)
Then we get:
$$
(i - i^\text{foreign})\uparrow \implies e \uparrow
$$
# Today's Class
Relaxing these assumptions
- No risk (or strictly, no risk differences): We will introduce **risk** (either of the exchange rate changing or default)
- Investors move money based on profit maximization: We will introduce **international reserves** which are managed by the central bank (or Finance Ministry) to achieve broader macroeconomic objectives, not necessarily return arbitrage
- Investors can freely move money (arbitrage): We will introduce **capital controls** which limit the free movement of money
## Why are we relaxing these assumptions?
**Better understand the world.** Interest rates and exchange rates often do not move the way our credit market and UIP models would predict--adding in some complications can help us better understand.
**Understand broader policy options to preserve flexibility.** Countries often have different considerations for different variables like interest rates and exchange rates---or more fundamental macroeconomic quantities like output/employment or the CA balance. A richer set of tools can give them a greater set of options than just having the choice of points that lie on the UIP curve
# Risk
## Countries that have higher default (or other) risks also have higher interest rates

## Can introduce risk into the UIP equation
$$
(1+i) - \text{home risk differential} = \left(\frac{e}{e^\text{expected}}\right)(1+i^\text{foreign})
$$
- Intuition: First part of left half: If you invest 1 at home, you will have this at the ned of the period. Second part of right half: If you convert 1 into foreign currency, invest it abroad, and then convert back at the end of the period you will end up with this total (Appreciation hurts you.)
- Added element: If the home country is riskier, then that is like a lower risk-adjusted return (Or vice versa)

## Default risk (and the possibility of dropping the fixed rate, or exiting euro) can raise rates

# International Reserves
## What if you want to keep your exchange rate stronger or interest rates lower?
![[Pasted image 20240408180831.png]]
without international reserves, pick point along curve and investors will be happy
- Investors will not be willing to be outside curve; lose money on IR if low, and lose money on exchange rate high because expected depreciation
## International reserves can be used to increase flexibility---called "exchange rate intervention"
UIP assumes that investors move their money in search of the highest returns---a reasonable assumption for **private investors.** This results in the elimination of **arbitrage** opportunities as the risk/exchange rate adjusted returns will be equal across countries.

**Central banks** also can be major investors in global financial markets and they make their choices not necessarily to maximize returns but for other considerations including:
- Trying to move exchange rate in a certain direction (e;.g. to help exporters or to help consumers)
- Accumulating funds to increase resiliency against future shocks, including fighting against speculative currency attacks.
- Foreign exchange intervention
The funds central banks use for these purposes are called **international reserves.**
## Reverses in selected emerging market economies
![[Pasted image 20240408181406.png]]
## UIP does not necessarily hold if a country uses international reserves
With a big international investor like a central bank, it is *possible* to sustain risk/exchange rate-adjusted returns of ex. 4% in the home country while the foreign return is 3% or 5%

Can pick the exchange rate and interest rate independently to maximize two independent objectives---not just limited to a point on the UIP curve.

Note there are limits to how much and how long this can occur because even large central banks have limited resources compared with private investors collectively
![[Pasted image 20240408181710.png]]
## Intuition on how to use reserves to prevent a currency from devaluing
If there is pressure on the exchange rate to devalue:
- For example, the rate of return at home is 3.5% (adjusted for risk) and abroad is 4%. The country does not want to raise its interest rate that is necessary to prevent its currency from devaluing because it has domestic reasons not to want high interest rates.
- In this case, investors will be trying to trade in local currency to buy foreign currency to invest abroad to get the higher return
- The central bank could meet this demand by purchasing the domestic currency in exchange for international reserves
- Intuitively, buying domestic currency with (say) dollar strengthens the domestic currency
- Note: International reserves are finite, so this works temporarily to smooth an adjustment or deal with a temporary disruption, but not indefinitely
![[Pasted image 20240408182550.png]]
## Reserves can also be used to keep the exchange rate weaker, preventing appreciation (less common)
If there is pressure on the exchange rate to appreciate:
- For example, rate of return at 8% (adjusted for risk) and abroad it is 5%. The country does not want to cut its interest rate to prevent its currency from revaluing because it has domestic reasons not to want low interest rates.
- In this case, investors will be trying to trade in foreign currency to buy local currency to invest at home to get the higher return.
- The central bank could meet this demand by purchasing the foreign currency (i.e., building up reserves) in exchange for domestic currency
- Intuitively: Selling domestic currency for (say) dollars weakens to domestic currency
Note: The purchases are being made with domestic currency which is *potentially infinite*. So this process can happen indefinitely and need not end in an abrupt currency movement---but it does risk triggering inflation

# Capital Controls
## Capital controls can also give a country more flexibility---at a possibly lower cost
**Capital controls** are rules that limit capital inflows (limiting how much foreigners can invest in your country) or capital outflows (limiting how much your residents can invest abroad)

With capital controls **arbitrage opportunities might not be (fully) eliminated.** For example, suppose IR is 4% in home country and 5% abroad. Normally, money would move from home to abroad until rates of return, adjusted for expected exchange rate changes, were the same. with capital controls, the return differential can persist because it may not be possible to legally move the money.

Unlike international reserves, capital controls do not require the government to have or expend foreign currency resources.
![[Pasted image 20240408191529.png]]
- Emerging markets usually
## Capital controls limit investors' ability to move money back and forth
Capital controls include:
- Limits on domestic residents investing overseas (e.g. Bolivia, China, Nigeria)
- Limits on foreign residents investing in the home country (e.g., Australia, India Korea)
- Special taxes on money moving in or out of a country (e.g., Australia, Canada)
- Less favorable exchange rates when converting money for investment purposes (e.g., Cuba, Lebanon)
## UIP does not necessarily hold if a country uses capital controls
Note there are limits to how much and how long this can occur because investors seeking higher returns are a powerful force.

- Diff types of corruption to avoid if set too extreme
![[Pasted image 20240408192024.png]]
## Capital controls can be helpful but have limits
- Can limit benefits of capital flows like the financing and diversification they can provide
- If they are trying to keep the economy very far from its market equilibrium for a sustained time will lead to attempts to circumvent the controls, like black markets and corruption
- Can distort allocation of capital, directing it to areas where the rules are weaker
- Can hurt small businesses, which have harder time complying with rules
- Can make a country less attractive to foreign investors over the longer term
## Latest IMF thinking is more sympathetic to capital controls in some circumstances

# Exchange Rate Crises
## Types of economic crises
Previously:
- Bank runs and financial crises
- Hyperinflation
- Sovereign debt defaults
Now:
- Currency crises. Sometimes defined as an abrupt depreciation of 25% or more.
Note: These crises can often occur together.
![[Pasted image 20240408192923.png]]
## Very common with pegged exchange rates and can lead to a currency crisis
- UK in 1992
- Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea in 1997
- Russia and Brazil in 1998
- Argentina 2001 and 2018
- Sri Lanka in 2022
- So many more
Note: Severely damaging currency crises have been less common in recent years because: (1) Fewer pegged exchange rates and (2) Countries generally maintain more reserves
## Causes of currency crises
Generally happen w/fixed exchange rates because flexible exchange rates tend not to have large abrupt changes:
- Fixed exchange rate is set to "wrong" value and the government does not have enough foreign currency to defend the exchange rate
- Self-fulfilling speculative attack: Believe currency will fall, so those holding the currency sell it, so it falls
- Investors worry a country will default on its debt so try to convert money to dollars
- Political events that lead to instability or sanctions
## Some consequences of currency crises
- Government can lose a lot of foreign currency trying to defend its exchange rate---leaving little left to cover needed imports
- Country may have to raise interest rates very high to defend its exchange rate, causing a recession
- Difficulty repaying debt denominated in dollars because it requires more local currency to repay
- May help trigger a financial crisis with even worse consequences
Note: Sometimes countries come out of currency crises without being hurt and even being helped (can boost exports)
# Should Exchange Rates be Floating or Fixed?
## Trade benefits of currency unions or pegged exchange rates may be very large
![[Pasted image 20240408194024.png]]
## Theory: What happens to the home economy when the foreign one raises interest rates
**Floating exchange rate**
- No change in domestic interest rate
- Domestic exchange rate depreciates, NX goes up, GDP goes up 
**Fixed exchange rate**
- Home country interest rates go up
- Investment goes down, GDP goes down

## Choice of nominal anchor
- **Inflation targets as nominal anchor.** In most advanced economics the nominal anchor is the central bank's commitment to something like a 2% inflation target
- **Fixed exchange rates as a nominal anchor.** In many emerging and developing economies a fixed exchange rate acts as a nominal anchor---not letting inflation get too far away from the country it is pegging to
	- A fixed exchange rate as a nominal anchor may show commitment and be easy to verify
	- Fixing to a more credible country is a way to effectively import that country's monetary policy credibility
- Quantity of money: Doesn't work, can't expand money when need to 
![[Pasted image 20240408194758.png]]
- Fixed IR: import foreign monetary policy
- Fixed e: Import IR of country fixed to
## Summary: Which exchange rate regime is best?
**Advantages of a floating exchange rate**
- Exchange rate automatically adjusts to cushion macroeconomic shocks
- Can use wise monetary policy to stabilize the economy
- Lower risk of currency crashes
**Advantages of a fixed exchange rate**
- Reduces frequent large fluctuations, making it easier for exporters, importers, and recipients of foreign investment
- Constrains governments from unwise monetary policy that destabilizes the economy
- Transparent nominal anchor
## The balance of pros and cons depends on the country: reasons for wanting to fix
- **It has a large trade share.** Trade is relatively large for Denmark but relatively small for the US.
- **It faces similar shocks as the country it is pegging to.** Denmark may have given up its monetary policy, but if its recessions/booms are the same as the euro area's then it will get about the right monetary policy at about the right time. In contrast, for an economy like Hong Kong to peg to the USD it gets monetary expansions/contractions at times that may not make sense for it.
- **It has irresponsible monetary authorities.** In Ecuador, monetary policies were irresponsible, so it dollarized. Dollarizing may be costly in some respects, but less so than badly run monetary policy. In contrast, Colombia has had more responsible monetary policies so the costs of dollarizing would outweigh the benefits.  
- **It is willing and able to have capital controls.** Capital controls enable some of the benefits of a pegged exchange rate without losing all monetary control.
