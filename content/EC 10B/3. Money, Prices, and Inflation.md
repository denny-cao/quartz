# Money
High-level def: Asset that people use to make and receive payments when buying and selling goods and services 
## What is Money Conceptually?
**Medium of exchange**: Something that can be exchanged in return for goods and services, thereby facilitating trade
**Store of value**: Enables people to transfer purchasing power into the future
**Unit of account**: A universal yardstick that expresses the price of different goods and services

Money/Money Supply/M2: Currency in circulation, checking accounts, saving accounts, and most other types of (highly liquid) bank accounts

## What is not Money?
- Bitcoin: Store of value (though highly volatile), but it is **not a common medium of exchange nor is it a universal yardstick**
# Inflation
## Blessing and Curse of Money
**Blessing**: Flexible, useful tool for economic interaction that can expand as needed

**Curse**: Money may not have an intrinsic value. If its quantity is not limited in some way its buying power may fall (**Inflation**)

Can easily adjust up and down, but sometimes over adjust -> Rapid increases in prices (inflation) or decrease (deflation)

## What is Inflation?
**The average increase in prices across the economy**.
- Focus on consumer price inflation: Change in the cost of the consumer spending bundle purchased by the average household
- Don't consider the price of one or a few goods going up to be inflation; its an increase in price but not overall inflation
- Measuring inflation in practice involves weighting the price increases of different goods and services in proportion to how much they are consumed
- Government statisticians try to make adjustments for new goods and improved quality but these are difficult to do accurately
Inflation calculations can be wrong: Argentina reported lower than should be to make things look better (politicized inflation)... US has managed to keep it not politicized, with experts handling it

Inflation rate from 12/2022 to 12/2023: 3.4%
- Many people **overestimate inflation**
	- Production of goods and services impacts inflation
	- Production of goods: not much inflation, falling prices (Laptops; have decreased price and more powerful... Technological improvement driving down prices)
	- Services tend to go up... Food.
	- Don't buy computers every day and thus see services inflation more... see more inflation than there actually is

- High income countries around 2% and stable rather than fluctuating... All experienced sharp jump in 2021, 2022, and came down 2023
- Low and middle-income economies tend to target 2-7% inflation

- Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the one public knows more about
- Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) is the one policymakers care about. More inclusive, broader
- Difference doesn't matter; almost identical answers historically
## What is Wrong With Inflation?
1. **Menu and shoe-leather costs**. Need to change prices more often. Experience hassle of holding less. ash (because inflation erodes its value)
	- Might not seem like an issue, but changing menus is a big cost for countries with big inflation
	- Costs of carrying money:
		- Lose value vs. investing
		- Theft, lost, etc.
		- Optimizing consumer: If low inflation and no theft, willing to carry a lot of money and go to ATM every few years. If opposite, carry around less and visit bank more (Going to bank more: Shoe-leather cost; wear down leather at bottom of shoes)
2. **Arbitrary redistribution of purchasing power**. Many long-term contracts are based on expected inflation or even have fixed nominal payments (ex. most private sector pensions have fixed nominal payments)
	- Used to sell at $X, now sell at $Y Y>X. Hurts wage workers, if contract and wage is fixed and not scaled by inflation...
	- Mortgage at 2% and now inflation goes from 2% to 10%... Winner is mortgage holder 
3. **People dislike inflation**. Even if a person is not financially harmed or even gains from inflation, they tend to deeply dislike inflation. Should policymakers care even if the sense of malaise is not fully rational?
	- Wages catch up with inflation rather quickly, but public doesn't see this
	- Unhappy due to false perceptions -> Ignore, or take into account is a big question
## Can Moderate Inflation Have Benefits?
1. **Raises money for the government**. Also called "seigniorage". The government gets more revenue by printing money.
2. **Facilitates relative price adjustment**. A key example is real wage adjustment: with inflation real wages can fall (even  if nominal wages are fixed), enabling firms to retain workers that the firm might otherwise be likely to fire.
	- Inflation allows employees to effectively reduce inflation adjusted payments they are making to workers -> Maybe firm is on brink of bankruptcy -> Allow them to keep workers without firing
3. **Gives the central bank more scope to use countercyclical monetary policy to respond to recessions**. 
# Determinants of Inflation in the Long Run
## Quantity Identity for Money
$$
M \times V \equiv P \times Y
$$
- Always true as we set $V$ to ensure it is
- $P \times Y$: Nominal GDP, $P:$ price level, $Y$: Real GDP
- $M$: Money, cash in circulation plus highly liquid accounts like checking accounts (does not include bank reserves)
- $V$: Velocity of Money: Number of times an average unit of money changes hands in a given period, like a year
## Mathematical Tool we Use
$$X = A \times B \implies x \approx a + b$$
- Comes from the fact that (gross) growth of $X$ is $(1 + x) = (1 + a)(1+b)$, and $ab$ is usually very small and thus can be disregarded in rounding
## Rewrite Quantity Identity as Growth Rates
$$
m + v \equiv \pi + y
$$
- $\pi + y$: Nominal GDP growth, $\pi$: Growth rate of $P$, or inflation, $y$: Growth rate of $Y$ or real GDP growth
- $m$: Growth rate of $M$
- $v$: Growth rate of $V$
## Assumption to Turn Quantity Identity for Money into Quantity Theory of Money
Simplifying assumption: $V$ is constant over time, so $V = (P \times Y)/M$ is constant, or $v =0$.

**This is used as a theory about the long-run. Don't use it as a short-run theory.**

## Quantity Theory of Money
Assuming $v = 0$:
$$
\pi = m-y
$$
 Inflation = money supply growth rate - real GDP growth rate
- Makes sense: If money stock increases, then money might be losing value because people have more of it than they want -> Get rid and lose value
- Subtract growth rate GDP because, if economy is getting bigger and bigger, then need more money to support all economic activity
- Race between money stock and real output

- Not true year to year; rougher relationship
![[Pasted image 20240202222254.png]]
- Pattern of moving together, but not moving together perfectly year to year, more of in the long run
![[Pasted image 20240202222327.png]]
- Way to think: Velocity fluctuates, but over a long period of time, relatively stable
# Hyperinflation
## Why might a country have very high inflation?
**Hyperinflation**: Price level doubles within three years (some definitions set a higher bar, like "50% inflation per month")

**Always** associated with a huge increase in the money supply. The reasons this could happen (and usually is all three):
1. **Misunderstanding**: Government tries to make the economy richer by printing more money, gets higher prices instead
2. **Big increase in spending and/or collapse in taxes**: Prints money to make up the difference between spending and taxes
3. **Loss of ability of government to borrow**: Like 2, prints money
## Illustrative Hyperinflations in History
- Ancient Rome (310 AD): Roman empire debases currency by adding more common metals (like copper and bronze)
- Germany (1923)
- Hungary (1946): Most extreme
	- Largest denomination ever printed: 100 million billion pengos
	- Prices doubled every 16 hours vs. 2% target: 35 years
- Zimbabwe (2008)
	- 100 thousand billion dollars
- Venezuela (2018)
## Some correlates of hyperinflation
- Historians believe German hyperinflation played role in weakening the Weimar Republic and the early rise of the Nazi Party 
	- Nail in the coffin: Opposite problem; deflation
- Global Great Depression (and an accompanying austerity program in Germany) was final critical push for Nazi Party to win power
- Venezuela GDP per capita fell from almost half
# National Anchors
 A "nominal anchor" pins down inflation and increases economic predictability
## Anchor 1: Fix Quantity of Money
Creating a rule limiting the issuance of fiat currency i.e. Milton Friedman's proposal to fix growth of money supply
- Upside: Easy to implement
- Downside: Fiscal and monetary policy are conducted in ways that cause the money supply to fluctuate (eg. having the government mail people checks that will raise the money supply because the deposited checks raises bank deposits)
## Anchor 2: Fix the Exchange Rate
In some economics, a fixed exchange rate (typically fixed to the US dollar or fixed by joining the Euro area) acts as a nominal anchor
- Upside: A fixed exchange rate adopts the (low) inflation rate of the country you are fixing against
- Downside:
	- Reduces monetary policy flexibility
	- Vulnerable to crises if cannot maintain the fixed exchange rate
# Anchor 3: Inflation Targeting
Most central banks now target an inflation rate (or range)
- Upside:
	- Targets what actually matters for the economy
	- If credible can be partly self-fulfilling, making it easier to achieve
- Downside:
	- If not credible can be very hard to achieve
	- Wrong target can have costly downsides
