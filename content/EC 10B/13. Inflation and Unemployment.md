# Quantity Theory of Money
- Long term, does not work well short-term
# Demand Shocks and Demand-Pull Inflation
- Demand can rise because incomes rise, taxes are cut, interest rates fall, and more
	- Mortgage rates drop so more home buyers (2020)
	- Retail sales explode due to stimulus checks (2021)
	- Cash-flush Americans lift US retail sales, shortages depress auto purchases 
- Effect of demand increases depends on the state of economy
	- Below potential: Demand increases raises Y (Factories are not at full capacity; hire unemployed to increase output)
	- At potential: Demand increases likely raises P (Factories are already at full capacities)
- Expansionary policy can raise employment/output in a below-potential economy, but can cause inflation in an at potential economy
## Phillips Curve
Can shorthand this as inflationary pressures are a function of the unemployment rate
![[Pasted image 20240318104212.png]]
- On the right side: Deep in recession, lower unemployment rate is like moving horizontally; increasing output, and doing so with very little additional inflation
- On the left side: Even small decrease in unemployment is like moving vertically; very little increase in output, and doing so with a lot of additional inflation
# Supply Shocks and Cost-Push Inflation
- Examples of supply shocks:
	- Russia invasion of Ukraine: Wheat prices went up because Ukraine is massive exporter of wheat
	- Same with oil prices (2021)
	- Global chip shortage (2022-2023); might not be supply shock (might be due to demand increase)
	- Baby formula supply problem due to factories shutting down
- Historically energy prices have been biggest supply shock
	- ![[Pasted image 20240318104729.png]]
	- Happen do to world events
		- War in middle east
		- Revolution in Iran
		- Russia invasion of Ukraine
- Core inflation: Excludes volatile categories, is a rough/imperfect proxy for demand
	- Look at underlying signal rather than overlying inflation which has a lot of noise (Energy supply shocks go away)
	- ![[Pasted image 20240318104929.png]]
	- PCE Measure: 2.0%
	- CPI Measure: 2.3%, what Fed has been targeting 
	- 2007: Inflation rate was almost 6%, but Fed wasn't worried because this was due to large increase in price of oil (Nothing to do with policies)
		- Didn't fight, because believed supply shock would go away
	- 2021-: Even when not taking into account of supply shock, still have a lot of inflation, so raise interest rates, decrease demand, etc.
# Inflation Expectations
- Expectations are key: Affecting how businesses set prices and workers negotiate wages
	- Workers in Europe demand higher pay due to increase in inflation
- Role of price (or inflation) expectations in the labor market:
	- Have been treating Y axis in labor market as nominal wages (with corresponding prices)
	- In reality: Y axis is **nominal wages given expected prices** and expected prices **can change**
	- Example:
		- Labor demand at nominal wage of $15 and expected prices of 100 is same as labor demand at a nominal wage of $20 and expected prices of 133
	- Same with labor supply
	- **Expected prices shift the labor supply and demand curves when shown in nominal wage space**
- Expectations were very well anchored going into COVID, and may still be well anchored
	- Fed Statement Jan 25, 2012: Communicating inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability (Set at 2%)
- Inflation expectations are back to where they were pre-COVID. Why?

# Bringing Them All Together: The Phillips Curve
$$
\text{Inflation} = E(\text{Inflation}) - f(\text{Unemployment Rate} - \text{Natural Rate}) + \text{Supply Shock}
$$
where 
$$
f(\text{Unemployment Rate} - \text{Natural Rate})
$$
is an increasing function and $f(0)=0$.
**Intuition**
- Unless something temporarily changes it, inflation will equal expected inflation. (Cannot have inflation persistently above or below expected inflation or expected inflation would eventually adjust)
- IF the unemployment rate is at the "natural rate", then there is no pressure for inflation to go up or down.
	- If unemployment rate < natural rate, then will put upward pressure on inflation (relative to expectations). And opposite if unemployment rate > natural rate
- Supply shocks add temporarily to inflation (Unless they raise expected inflation)
## Reminder: Natural Rate of Unemployment
- **Very hard to know precisely what it is**. It can change a lot, both over time and across countries.
- **Is not actually "natural"**. It depends on microeconomic institutions and policies
- **If a country tries to lower unemployment below the natural rate without changing these microeconomic determinants, can get higher nominal wages and higher/rising inflation**. What happens to real wages is open question.
- **Another open question is how much room there is for labor force participation to improve, thus raising the employment-population ratio**.
## Phillips Curve
$$
\pi = \pi^\Theta - f(U - U') + \text{Supply Shock}
$$
- **Demand change** is movement along the curve
	- ![[Pasted image 20240318110845.png]]
- **Supply shock** is shift of curve
	- ![[Pasted image 20240318110853.png]]
- **Expectation changes** are a shift of the curve
	- ![[Pasted image 20240318111238.png]]
- Short run curved, but long run vertical Phillips curve
## Intuition for short-run tradeoff but no long-run tradeoff
**Short-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation**: Can get lower unemployment at expense of inflation above your inflation anchor
**No long-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation**: In long-run, cannot sustainably stay above or below the natural rate because inflation cannot always be higher than expected.
## Policy Implications of This Model
- **Monetary policy should offset demand shocks**. Ex. negative demand shock like a financial crisis will raise unemployment and lower inflation. Expansionary monetary policy can help both.
- **Monetary policy should often "look through" temporary supply shocks**. Ex. increase in price of oil will raise inflation and could raise unemployment too. Also, if supply shock is transitory then inflation will come down. (Important caveat: If a supply shock might raise expected inflation, then may want to offset it)
- **Monetary policy and institutions will have more room if they are credible**. Keeping expectations anchored (through institutions like independent central banks, goals like an inflation target, or actions like raising interest rates to control inflation) can help ensure inflation is lower and more predictable, and create more room for stabilization.
# Reducing Inflation: Soft and Hard Landings
- Does it take a recession to lower inflation?
## Hard Landing
- Canonical hard landing: US Volcker disinflation with a deliberate recession
	- ![[Pasted image 20240318112940.png]]
 ![[Pasted image 20240318113107.png]]
# Soft Landing
![[Pasted image 20240318113310.png]]
- Brazil attempted, Argentina currently attempting
![[Pasted image 20240318113324.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240318113641.png]]
- Maybe US just had a soft landing (post-COVID)
	- Could just be in between: We are not fully out yet, or initially easy to decrease inflation with small increase in unemployment, but eventually need a large increase in unemployment to lower inflation by just a little ("The last mile of inflation could be the hardest")
# Key Ideas
- Phillips Curve: $\pi = \pi^\Theta - f(U - U') + \text{Suppy Shock}$. Gives rise to three sources of inflation:
	- **Demand Pull**. Demand increases PY, whether it increases P or Y depends on how much slack there is.
	- **Cost push**. Supply shocks can increase inflation, for example a higher price of oil.
	- **Inflation expectations**. Depend on central bank's credibility.
- There is a short-run tradeoff between unexpected inflation and unemployment. In the long run, cannot constantly surprise on inflation so there is no tradeoff.
- Disinflation can be painful ("sacrifice ratio") if it requires above natural rate unemployment or easy if expectations are credibly anchored
- Huge uncertainty around the natural rate and the exact dynamics of inflation
- History is filled with examples of hard landings where recessions brought down inflation ,soft landings have been much more rare.
