# Introducing National Income Accounting
## Measurement Identity ($\equiv$)
Use $\equiv$ when trying to highlight point that **two magnitudes are equal by definition**
- Ex. Height measured top to bottom $H$ and bottom to top $h$ is an identity $H \equiv h$
- Measurement error doesn't get in the way of identity; creates noise when measuring identity in practice
### Expenditures $\equiv$ Income
- Payments out to a firm by a household are the same as income received by the firm
	- Dollar value of expenditures $\equiv$ Dollar value of income received by sellers
	- Never identical in practice; measurement error
- OUTflow (Measure dollar sent) and INflow (Measure dollar received)
### Production
- Assign dollars to all products produced that are sold 
### Big Picture
- Dollar value of goods and services produced (Market **production**)
- Dollar value of spending on goods and services produced (Market **expenditure**)
- Dollar value of payments received by sellers of goods and services produced (Market **income**)
- Linked by an identity in concept; Production $\equiv$ Expenditure $\equiv$ Income
- Ways to measure GDP
### GDP
Generally only counts **market** activities (some exceptions)
- Counted towards GDP when transaction between two parties
- Measuring national aggregates of
	- Market production
	- Market expenditure
	- Market income
- Omit non-market activity 
### Ways to Measure GDP
- **Production concept**: Market value of all final goods and services produced by factors of production inside the borders of the country
- **Expenditure concept**: Market value of all expenditures on final goods and services produced by factors of production inside the borders of the country
- **Income concept**: Total income of factors of production inside the borders of the country
### Review
- **Production**: Sold to a person or a business or a government (Unsold items count as inventory; purchase by the business that made them)
- The production is an **expenditure** to the buyer
- This is **income** to the seller
### Final Good Value $\equiv$ Sum Value Added
X sells to Y for $5, Y sells to Z for $9, Z sells to K for $40. 
**Incremental production value added**:
- X contributes $5 to economy, Y contributes 9 - 5 = $4 to economy, Z contributes 40 - 9 = $31 to economy.
**Final good and incremental production value added is the same**. 
### GDP is a flow, we sometimes also consider stock variables 
- Ex. Wealth
- Flow (GDP): Amount produced per unit of time (ex. quarter or a year)
- Stock (Wealth): Total amount that people have (measured at a given point in time)
### National Income Accounting Identity for Expenditure-Based GDP
$$
Y \equiv C + I + G + (X - M)
$$
$Y$: GDP
$C$: Consumer Spending (Durables, non-durables, services)
$I$: Investment (Business Fixed Investment, Residential Fixed Investment, Inventories, **NOT financial transactions like stock market "investment"**... Investment in physical things)
$G$: Government purchases (Goods, Services, Investments **NOT government transfers like SS**)
$X-M$: Exports - Imports
- **Purchases of imported goods are counted twice, once negatively, and thereby zeroed out**
# Limits and Uses of GDP
## Societal Problems
- Some of what is measured in GDP is associated with societal problems (**NOT** well-being)
- Examples:
	- Expenditures for crime prevention/response to crime
	- Expenditures on equipment and services associated with controlling protests
	- Productive activities that have negative externalities 
## Important for Well-being but NOT in GDP
- Home production
- Leisure
- Depreciation of physical capital
- How **GDP is distributed**
- Health, happiness, etc.
## Across countries GDP lines up well with incomes over all percentiles
- Per capita GDP is proportional to per capita GDP for bottom quintile amongst all countries. Same as growth in GDP.
## Strongly Predicts Health, as well as Happiness
- Higher GDP -> Better health and happiness
## Alternative Measures
- Human Development Index (UN): Life expectancy, education, and per capita income
	- Doesn't change much; life expectancy and education is impacted by GDP
- Sustainable Development Goals (UN): Includes 17 topline goals and a total of about 200 measures
- Multi-dimensional Living Standards (OECD): Income, income distribution, life expectancy, and unemployment combined in a welfare-theoretic manner
- Better Life Index (OECD): Many including income, jobs work-life balance, environment, community, with a custom user weighting
- Distributional National Accounts (Piketty, Saez, and Zucman): Show total national income broken out separately for different groups
## Happiness hasn't increased since we've started consistently measuring it
- We see it in other countries though
## Income and Happiness
- Per capita income is a strong predictor of happiness in the cross-section of **countries**
- Income is a weak predictor of happiness in the cross-section of **individuals**
- Rising per-capita income in the US has not been associated with rising reported life satisfcation and happiness, although rising per-capita income in most other countries has riseing reported life satifcation
