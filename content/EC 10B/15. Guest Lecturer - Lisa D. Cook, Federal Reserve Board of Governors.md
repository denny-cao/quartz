Fed Dual Mandate: Promote maximum employment and stable prices
 - Maximum employment 
	 - Coretta Scott King: Unemployment is a massive factor holding back disadvantaged communities and people; root of all our major social problems
	 - Painful consequences of workers and families; reduced living standards and poverty
	 - High levels of employment: Vibrant, thriving economy operating at maximum efficiency -> Boosting productivity and long run growth potential 
	 - Development of new ideas; diverse, more invention, and more innovation
	 - Strong labor market increases labor force participation and makes employers more willing to recruit and upgrade skills of workers
		 - Brings those in sidelines of labor market with skills that can be developed if given a chance
- Stable prices/low inflation:
	- Expected changes in general price levels do not change actions of businesses and households
	- Make sound decisions regarding saving, borrowing, and investment -> Contribute to economy
	- Promotes favorable environment for investing and productive capacity and human potential
	- Price stability: Avoiding periods of high inflation; burden to those who are disadvantaged and least able to bear it
	- Creates conditions for sustainability in economy
	- More forceful monetary policy response if inflation fluctuates a lot
	- Employment can rise more steadily
	- Specific inflation rate is new development; Jan 2012 FOMC: 2% over long run is most consistent with dual mandate
Why 2% instead of 0%?
- Near zero: Can slide into sustained deflation - job losses, debt burdens
- Gives room for monetary policy adjustments to achieve real interest rate sufficiently negative to provide stimulus during economic downturns
Employment often secondary mandate to price stability even with countries w/o dual mandate
- Employment affects speed at which they return  inflation to target
- US: More explicit. No target for unemployment rate
- Natural rate of unemployment: Rate of unemployment compatible with steady inflation rate
	- Changes over time as economy evolves
- Tradeoff between two goals:
	- Monetary policy: Can control inflation over long run
	- Employment rate: Structural forces and economic policies beyond monetary policy
	- Short run: Often suggest same same course of action (Demand shocks)
	- Supply shock: Tend to impact both inflation and unemployment at first -> Short run trade off from monetary policy 
	- FOMC: Committee's mandates are generally complementary, however, under circumstances in which committee judges they are not, take into account employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and potentially different time horizions over whcih emplyomenta nd infaltion are projected to return to levels consistent with mandate
	- Implied forceful tightening of monetary policy
How to evaluate mandate goals:
- Inflation: Look at 12 month change in PCE price index

- Don't just use ambiguous data to American public; Zillow, etc.
	- High frequency data to attempt to predict future of data
- Inflation expectations
