# Why does international macroeconomic coordination happen and what does it do?
- **Learn from each other**
	- E.g. central bankers and finance ministers share ideas, like inflation targeting
- **Coordination, especially in crisis response**
	- E.g. G20 coordinated monetary and fiscal response to financial crisis
	- Swap lines during COVID: US Fed lend money overnight and swap money with other banks to ensure they have enough liquidity 
- **Help address positive and negative spillovers from national policies**
	- E.g. Euro area limits on deficits and debt
- **Overcoming domestic obstacles to "good" economic policies (can be controversial)**
	- E.g. China joining WTO imposed market reform obligations on them
# Obstacles to Macroeconomic Policy Coordination
- **Countries may have different interests.** This could be different stages of the business cycle, different inflation rates, or different external balances---this is very hard/impossible to overcome
- **Countries may have different ideas.** For example, views on the appropriateness of fiscal expansions and the costs of debt varies across countries
- **Moreover, there are no real enforcement mechanisms**
- # Bretton Woods Institutions 
- **World Bank Group**
- - Partly like a normal bank except it only loans to middle-income governments (largest borrowers: Indonesia, Brazil, China, India, Mexico)
- Partly like a foreign aid agency that makes grants and zero interest loans to low-income governments (largest recipients: Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Kenya)
**World Trade Organization**
- Negotiations global trade agreements (last one was completed in 1994)
- Judges and permits enforcement of trade agreements
	- Tariffs if broken
**International Monetary Fund**
- A little like a global central bank
# The IMF is like a central bank, with two major limitations
**Lender of last resort to governments.** Governments turn to the IMF when they are in crisis and no one else will lend to them (at reasonable or even any interest rates)
	- For example, a country has a large CA deficit, is borrowing from abroad, but faces a "**sudden stop**" where foreign lending stops. Has happened numerous times (e.g. Argentina and Greece)
- The IMF does not take collateral (can't seize a country's assets)---instead uses **conditionality.** Conditionally includes requirements that countries adopt actions like eliminating price controls, tightening monetary policy, floating exchanger rates, or cutting government spending as a condition for getting loans
- **The IMF has limited resources.** "Owned" by its 190 member countries. They have granted it resources that enable it to lend up to $1 trillion.
## Most of the IMF's funding is loans from member countries---only cost is the very low default risk
**Most of the $1 trillion the IMF can lend is backed by a commitment of its 190 member countries to lend to it if needed.** The US has an open commitment of approximately $184 billion. This is effectively a credit line to the IMF (Note, member countries' votes on IMF decisions are based on their contributions, so the US gets 17% of the votes and China gets 6%)
- If IMF draws money, then it pays interest to the US (and other countries) roughly equal to IR on US debt -> No net cost to the US
- IMF lends money at interest and charges a higher interest rate than its funding cost. Its loans are senior (meaning they are repaid before all other loans) and historically, virtually all of them have been repaid
- The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a $100 billion additional commitment to the IMF costs the US $2 billion because of the small chance of a global catastrophe that leads to widespread non-repayment of loans
## Complements or alternatives to Bretton Woods Institutions?
Needs of global economy far outstrip what they can do, so new institutions:
**Longer-standing multilateral development banks.** Like World Bank but limited to certain regions including:
- Asian Development Bank (HQ in Tokyo)
- European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (HQ in London)
- Inter-American Development Bank (HQ in DC)
- African Development Bank (HQ in Abidjan)
- Islamic Development Bank (HQ in Jeddah)
**The new institutions:**
- **Asian Investment and Infastructure Bank** (HQ in Beijing)
- **New Development Bank** (aka BRICS bank established by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, HQ in Shanghai)
# Gita Gopinath, First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- Difficult to forecast w/unseen shock; human side of economics
- Shift towards national security -> No policies in place for this environment
- Industrial policy: favor own firms and own workers
- Blocks; trade between blocks decreased more than trade within blocks (US and others, Europe and others, China and Russia and others)
- Global trade GDP way more than previous; cost of fragmenting trade flows is higher
- China share in US import decreased; used to be largest
	- US imports from Mexico and Vietnam have grown a lot
- Attenuated some of the cost, how much resilience? 
- Economies are so integrated -> Costly if another cold war so attempt to put safeguards to minimize fragmentation
- Climate agreement; maintain relations by working together on common agreement
- Convening power to bring people on the table
- Fully free markets doesn't give best outcomes
- IMF criticism: fiscal austerity... spending more than collect
- Cut spending, but not on poorest countries
- Capital controls: Foreign exchange intervention. Many countries in world intervene in foreign exchange markets and restrict capital inflow and outflow... want to let currency free flow but now, IMF recognized international capital flow has some costs... No developed markets -> Hot money, economy overheats, goes out, crash
- Less worried about inflation: influenced by last decade of period at zero lower bound. Interest rates at the bottom. Slogan: Good to run economy hot. Keep IR low, benefits of more people entering labor markets w/o inflation. 2021: UR is high, gov spending -> Inflation will go up. What happened: Pandemic is unique because, supply shocks would have goods -> Labor market -> Wages. 
- Be less anchored to previous models with unseen shocks
- Debt sustainability: 
	- Go to shop for debt restructuring IMF
		- Debt gets to level where they cannot make payments without cutting food, etc.
	- Composition of debt, maturity structure, currency composition
- Judgement: Depending on depth of financial markets
- Dollar: US Treasury bonds -> everyone holds -> US debt carrying capacity is much higher than other countries
- Common framework: Form that says we're going to end up a way to do restructuring so that everyone gets common treatment
