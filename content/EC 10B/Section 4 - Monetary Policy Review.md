# Review of Fluctuations
- Goal for Unit 2: Understanding macroeconomic fluctuations and how monetary policy can mitigate their negative effects
- Negative effects:
	- Recessions
	- High inflation
## Tools for Analyzing Economic Fluctuations
- Supply: Y = A * F(K,H)
- Demand: Y = C(Y - T, r, ...) + I(Y, r, ...) + G + (X-M)
- Labor market (links them)
- Credit market (pins down r)
## Labor Market Links Supply and Demand
C, I, G, or (X-M) (Shock impacts one of these)
Causes change in labor demand
Causes change in human capital
Changes Y
# Monetary Policy Overview
## Short-Run Policy Tools
- Policymakers can use **monetary policy, fiscal policy**, or **hybrid policies** (use mix of both) to raise or lower demand
- In recession, policymakers try to **raise** demand (maximum employment)
- In times of high inflation, policymakers try to **lower** demand (stable prices)
## Aggregate Demand
$$
Y=C(Y-T,r) + I(Y,r) + G + (X-M)
$$
- Y is now **demand** for real goods and services
	- Changes in demand might produce changes in real output, but that depends on supply in economy
**Expansionary monetary policy** lowers **interest rates**, which increases demand for borrowing for consumption and investment
- Firms need to hire more labor to produce more C and I, so labor demand shifts right
- **Increases** credit supply (Supply shift to the right, so interest rates go down and quantity of lending/borrowing increases)
**Contractionary monetary policy** raises **interest rates**, which reduces demand for borrowing and consumption and investment (labor demand shifts left)
- **Decreases** credit supply (Supply shift to the left, so interest rates go up and quantity of lending/borrowing decreases)
## Market for credit determines real interest rate

## How does Fed affect real interest rates?
**Method 1**: Setting the federal funds rate (via changes to the interest rate paid on bank reserves held at the Fed)
- Short-term rates affect long-term rates
- Lose money if set below interest on reserve rate and thus affects short-term and long-term rates (Has effect on all other links in chain)
**Method 2**: Purchasing or selling treasuries and/or mortgage-backed securities (QE and QT)
- Directly affects long-term rates
- Buy assets from who is holding them and pushes down long-term rates, or sell to bring them up (Price and rates are inversely related)
	- Increase demand of treasuries -> Higher price -> Yield from interest rate decreases 
	- $$P = \frac{FV}{(1+r)^T}$$
## Why do banks hold reserves at the Fed?
- **Daily liquidity needs**
	- Banks need cash or cash-like assets to cover withdrawals, to make new loans
	- Reserves can be borrowed from other banks on high-need days, lent to other banks on low-need days
- **Reserves earn interest**
	- Low-risk, highly-liquid assets that earn more interest than cash
## Link between IOR and FFR
- Fed's choice of IOR pins down the FFR (IOR > FFR)
	- Why would a bank loan out reserves for less than the interest rate it receives for holding onto them itself?
	- Think of the IOR as the opportunity cost of loaning out reserves
	- In a competitive market, the price of borrowing reserves will be driven down very close tot he cost of lending (plus a little bit of compensation for the service provided)
## Interest rates move together
**Rule 1:** Interest rates on similar assets move together
- Supply and demand in asset markets
- If IOR falls, demand for other short-term, liquid assets (eg. T-bills) goes up, interest rates fall
**Rule 2**: Long-term rates reflect the average of expected short-term rates
- As short-term rates fall, long-term rates fall too
## Long-term rates reflect the average of expected short-term rates
- If the interest rate on a ten-year loan is higher than the expected return on a group of one-year loans, banks will supply more ten-year loans, driving down the price
- If the interest rate on a ten-year loan is lower than the expected return on the group of one-year loans, banks will supply fewer ten-year loans, driving up the price
## Interest rates comove with the FFR but far from exactly
## Open Market Operations (QE and QT)
When Fed buys treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities from banks:
- Banks receive payment in the form of reserves
- Higher demand for those bonds leads to higher prices and lower interest rates
- Lower interest rates on treasuries lead to lower interest rates on corporate bonds
- Lower interest rates on mortgage-backed securities lead to lower mortgage rates
- Assuming stable inflation expectations, lower nominal interest rates lead to lower inflation rates $i = r + \pi$
Selling: Opposite
## Monetary policy and the credit supply curve
Both (1) and (2) affect credit supply curve
- Think of the IOR as OC of lending (holding reserves is an alternative to making loans), and lending as supplying credit
- Buying a newly-issued bond = supplying credit to the bond issuer, so greater demand for bonds is greater supply of credit avaialable to those issuing bonds
