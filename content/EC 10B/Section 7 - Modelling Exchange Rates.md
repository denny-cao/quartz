# Overview and Review
- Unit 4 extends our discussion of short-run macroeconomic policy to include the linkages between economies
- Today: **Exchange rates**, a fundamental building block of international macroeconomics
- Because different countries use different currencies, we need to understand the exchange rates between them and how they are determined
# Exchange Rate Background
 Currently costs 0.88 Swiss francs to buy 1 USD
**(Indirect) Exchange Rate:** Foreign currency cost for one unit of domestic currency
$$
e = \frac{\text{Units of foreign currency}}{\text{1 Unit of domestic currency}}
$$
- When $e$ goes up, strengthening of USD, and weakening when opposite
## Exchange Rate Appreciation
- Could become more expensive to buy a $1. For example, cost could raise from 0.88 SFr to 1.10 SFr.
- Dollar is now more valuable: $1 buys more of a foreign currency
- In this case, $e \uparrow$
- We use a variety of words for this: an **appreciation** or **strengthening** of the dollar relative to the Swiss franc. In the case of a fixed exchange rate we also call this a **revaluation** of the exchange rate.

Two different ways of quoting exchange rates:
- **Indirect Terms**: cost of $ for foreigners 
- **Direct Terms**: cost of foreign currency for US
## Note on currency terminology
- We will use indirect terms: A larger value is an appreciation, and a smaller value is a depreciation of "our" currency
- In newspapers/some textbooks/classes, you will also sometimes see exchange rates quoted in direct terms. In this case a larger value is a depreciation of the home currency
- "Up" and "down" are ambiguous so we will try to avoid them. "Appreciation/stronger/revaluation" and "Depreciation/weaker/devaluation" are well-defined and thus preferable
- Ask yourself if the dollar (or "your" currency) can buy more or less than before, not if the exchange rate goes up or down
## Is it better to have a strong or a weak currency?
- "Strong" sounds good while "weak" sounds bad. But that is the wrong way to think about exchange rates
- A strong currency is good for consumers buying foreign goods, a weak currency is good for producers selling goods to foreigners
- The desirable value of the exchange rate depends---in some circumstances, actions to appreciate the exchange rate may be better and in others, actions to depreciate it may be better
# The Foreign Exchange Market
**Financial market arbitrage happens at a large scale very quickly**
- Annual global GDP: ~$100 trillion
- Annual global trade volume: ~$39 trillion
- Annual currency transactions: ~$2,700 trillion
- Currency transactions are ~70 times global trade
## Key Takeaway
**When domestic interest rates rise relative to foreign interest rates, all else equal, the nominal exchange rate appreciates.**
$$
(i - i^{\text{foreign}})\uparrow \implies e \uparrow
$$
One way to understand this intuitively:
- When the US interest rates go up relative to the foreign interest rate then the dollar becomes more attractive because investors want the higher interest rate. This leads investors to buy more dollars, appreciating the exchange rate
## Investors can invest anywhere in the world
Data in December 2006:
- One-year US government bond: 5% interest rate
- One-year German government bond: 4% interest rate
- Exchange rate: 0.75 â‚¬/$
**Why would anyone have invested in Germany when they could get a higher interest rate in the US?**
- Exchange rate movements are expected to make investments equivalent in the two countries (Simplifying by ignoring certain issues around risk)
## How interest rate differences can predict exchange rate changes
- With $100 to invest:
	- US: Get $105 in one year
	- Convert $100 to 75 euros: 78 euros in one year (1.04 * 75). Convert it back to dollars at the exchange rate TBD a year from now
- In equilibrium, will be indifferent between the two investments:
	- Exchange rate a year from now must be 78/105 = 0.743 euros/$.
- Intuitively, German interest rate is lower but German currency is expected to **strengthen** (opposite of the dollar weakening). So that is expected to make up for the lower interest rate in Germany.
## Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP)
$$
(1+i) = \left(\frac{e}{e^\text{expected}}\right)
(1+i^\text{foreign})$$
Left hand side: Invest at home. If you invest 1 at home, you will have this at the end of one year

Right hand side: Invest abroad. If you convert 1 into foreign currency, invest it abroad, and then convert back at the end of the period you will end up with this total (Appreciation of the home currency hurts you)
## Simplifying Assumptions
**Take as given:**
$i^f$: Set by foreign central bank
$e^e$: In more advanced courses, learn "Relative Purchasing Power Parity" (in long run, exchange rate determined so that the relative prices of goods in the foreign and home countries stay the same.) For simplicity in Ec10, will just take it as a given and unchanged by anything done domestically or abroad
**Solve for:**
$e$ and $i$

Thus:
- If $i$ increases, $e$ must increase for no arbitrage to occur
- Because there is no change to $e^e$, there is a larger expected depreciation of the exchange rate in the future, which balances out the high domestic interest rate, preserving equilibrium in financial markets
## Key Takeaway
$$
(i - i^f)
\uparrow \implies e\uparrow$$
To ways to understand intuitively:
- Previous
- Full version: The appreciation in the present with an unchanged expected future exchange rate means there is an expected depreciation. This expected depreciation offsets the increase in $i$ relative to $i^f$---ensuring that returns are equal in the two locations.
## UIP Curve

![[Pasted image 20240331213015.png]]
## Three assumptions implicit in this model
- No risk (or strictly, no risk differences)
- Investors can freely move money including no transaction costs (arbitrage)
- Investors move money based on profit maximization
# Floating Exchange Rates
![[Pasted image 20240331214936.png]]
- Floating exchange rates not common; short list of countries
![[Pasted image 20240331215258.png]]
### Modeling a floating exchange rate
![[Pasted image 20240331215340.png]]
- Assume that interest rates are set by the central bank or by the credit market
- Interest rates then determine the exchange rate
	- UIP curve doesn't shift because foreign monetary policy hasn't changed, expectations about the future exchange rate hasn't changed; just domestic monetary policy
	- Expansionary monetary policy -> Currency appreciation since it drives more investors in US currency (Higher interest rates)
- Changes to **domestic interest rates** produce a movement along the UIP curve
	- Decrease in foreign interest rates -> Currency appreciation from shift in UIP to the left since it drives more investors in US currency (Higher interest rates)
- Changes to **foreign interest rates** cause a shift in the UIP curve
Note: Simplified because foreign policy changes can affect the domestic credit market
# Fixed Exchange Rate
## Modeling a Fixed Exchange Rate
![[Pasted image 20240331222625.png]]
- Lose monetary policy authority; have to set interest rates based on what foreign interest rates are 
## Understanding a fixed exchange rate
- Assume that the exchange rate is set by the Finance Ministry
- The central bank must adjust interest rates (or let the market adjust them) to maintain this fixed exchange rate
- Otherwise, all investors would want to move their money into/out of the country
- **Domestic interest rates** cannot change because the exchange rate cannot be allowed to change
- Changes to **foreign interest rates** must be matched by changes to domestic interest rates to prevent the exchange rate from changing
## With a fixed exchange rate, a country's interest rates must match foreign rates
**If Denmark fixes its exchange rate to the euro, then German investors can**:
- Invest their money in German bonds
- Convert their euro into Kroner, invest their money in Danish bonds, earn Danish interest rates, and convert their Kroner back to euro
Rate of return on these two activities must be identical assuming the fixed exchange rate is credible and no difference in the underlying risk of the bonds

**The country fixing its exchange rate is unable to engage in discretionary monetary policy**

## Many exchange rates fall in a continuum between purely fixed and floating
