# Great Depression
- Stock market fell by 87% during the Great Depression
-  Initial onset: Market lost 11% of its value at the opening bell (but then partially recovered later in the day)
- Dust Bowl: Agricultural and climate crisis in the Great Plains
	- Ground dried up, over-farming, poor treatment of topsoil, drought, fields got blown away
## Dust Bowl
- Farmer's couldn't make their mortgage payments
- Banks took possession of farms, which were the collateral on those mortgages
- Because land prices were plummeting, the local banks failed as well
- Millions of displaced people migrated out of the Dust Bowl to find work, often farm work in California (Region lost about 3.5 million people; only outmigration during this period)
- They were derogatorily referred to as Okies, a reference to Oklahoma, though many of these families came from other states in the affected region
## Socio-economic catastrophe

- Economy recovered, but still only to 10%
# Economic Fluctuations and Business Cycles
Short-run variations in the growth of GDP.
- Can examine these fluctuations by comparing the path of real GDP to a trend line
![[Pasted image 20240212165559.png]]
- Huge decrease: Great Depression
- Huge increase: WW2. Not due to higher QOL, but due to increase in production for war effort

2007: Great Recession or global financial crisis and did not reverse until 2009
2019: Sharp recession, rapid decline, rapid reverse
## Recessions (and Depressions)
- A **recession** in a high-income economy is defined as episodes of negative economic growth. Many low and middle-income economies have high trend growth rates (e.g. 6% real growth) so can have recessions with a low but still positive growth rate (e.g. 2% real growth)
- An **expansion** is the period between recessions. Expansions are characterized by sustained economic growth.
- Since 1929, a recession has occurred about once every six years in the US, and recessions have lasted on average about one year. However, they are not predictable. Many other countries have similar frequencies of recession.

- Silver lining: At least unemployment level is back to normal level, but GDP is way down
## Predictability
- Nine days before the 1929 stock crash, Irving Fisher stated that "stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau"
	- One of greatest economists of all time
	- Stock prices would instead fall by 87% (over the next four years)
- Forecasters at UCLA said second and third quarter growth rates of US GDP during 2020 were 1.3% and 0.6%. Normally annualized growth rate is 2%. 
	- Later revised to -6.5% and -1.9%
	- Reality: Even deeper recession
		- Actual decline in Q2: 29.9% (Annualized, which is comparable to numbers above)

- We use the labor market to see what is going on with the economy
- NOTE: There is lag between labor market and the economy; people do not get fired immediately; lose jobs a month later
- Reflection of what happened in the previous month, not a predictor of the next month
# Macroeconomic Equilibrium (Labor Market)
## Four Tools to Analyze Economic Fluctuations
1. **Supply**. $Y = A \times F(K,H)$ ($F$ is a function that takes $K$ and $H$ as inputs) $A$: Technology, $K$: Physical Capital, $H$: Human capital. 
2. **Demand**. $Y = C(Y-T, r, \dots) + I(Y,r,\dots) + G + (X-M)$
3. **Labor Market (Links Them)** ![[Pasted image 20240212183346.png]]
4. **Credit Market (pins down $r$)** ![[Pasted image 20240212183419.png]]
## Components of Aggregate Demand/Expenditure
$Y$: Income
$C(Y-T,r)$: Consumption component.
- $Y-T$: Disposable income; income - taxes
- $r$: Interest rates
- When disposable income goes up, consumption goes up, when $r$ goes up, consumption goes down
$I(Y,r)$: Investment component.
- Higher income, more optimistic on outlook of economy, more likely to invest in it
- Interest rates go up mean more expensive to make investment
$G$: Government
- Treat as exogenously set by government
$(X-M)$: Ignore for now
## Factors That Increase Consumption
- **Higher disposable income**: $C \simeq 0.9(Y-T)$ 
- **Lower interest rates**: Make it easier for households to borrow to purchase durable goods like cars and make saving less attractive
- **Increased wealth**: When the stock market goes up households tend to spend about 3% of its increased value over the next year
- **More optimism about the future**: Measured with "consumer confidence" or "consumer sentiment" surveys
## Factors That Increase Investment
- **Lower interest rates**
	- Businesses can borrow at lower cost to invest in plant or equipment
	- Households can borrow at lower cost to buy homes
- **Increased income (or cash flow)**: Businesses often finance investment outside of their own cash, when it is higher, they invest more
- **More optimism, including higher expected growth**: Businesses will invest more in anticipation of stronger future sales
- **More favorable taxes and regulations**: Government policies can affect the level and composition of investment

## Labor Market Links the Demand and Supply Sides of the Economy
![[Pasted image 20240212190920.png]]
## Types of Exogenous Economic Shocks
- **Supply (Real/Business Cycle)**
	- **Technology/productivity**. A shock that changes the economy's technological ability to produce: "A" in the production function 
- **Demand (Keynesian)**
	- **Expectations/animal spirits**. Consumers or businesses become more/less confident, affecting consumption and investment. Multipliers also play a role in amplifying the impact of all shocks.
	- **Monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policies**. These can affect demand and be stabilizing if done well or destabilization if done poorly.
- **Financial**
	- **Financial markets and financial institutions**. Fluctuations in asset prices and failures of financial institutions.
- **Global**
	- **Real or financial shocks**. Emanating from other countries.

## Natural Forces Can Restore Equilibrium After a Shock, the Question is How Long and Completely
Some "natural" (endogenous) ways the economy can automatically restore an equilibrium of full employment and no output gap after a shock:
- Real wages fall (potentially as prices rise)
- Households stop postponing expenditures like cars
- Labor/capital shift from failed to successful firms
- Inventory falls and needs to be rebuilt
- Financial system heals
(From order of slow)
## Expansionary Macroeconomics Can Speed the Economy's Healing
IF you have an economy operating below potential (ex. high unemployment), AND you think the natural recovery will take too long, you have three options:
- **Monetary Policy** (ex. Fed changes interest rates)
- **Fiscal Policy** (ex. spend money or cut taxes)
- **Hybrid Policies** (ex. Fed and Treasury working together on a financial rescue)
# Recession of 2007-2009
## Cause
- Fall in housing prices, which caused a 50% collapse in new residential construction (I)
- Sharp drop in consumption (C)
	- Job losses
	- Wealth losses
	- Precautionary savings
- Spiraling mortgage defaults that caused many bank failures, leading the entire financial system to freeze up

# Recession of 2020
## COVID-19
- Labor demand shifts to the left because
	- Consumers stay home to avoid infection (24% reduction in time away from home), reducing demand for the goods and services that firms produce (C)
	- Consumers lose their own jobs and some cut back expenditure (unemployment rate rises from 3.5% to 14.8%) (C)
	- Firms stop buying capital, because they anticipate that they can't sell the goods and services that the capital will produce (I)
	- Supply chains are broken, reducing productivity of labor
- Creates unemployment because of downward rigid nominal wages (Labor supply also shifted left, but not as much)
- C and I both fall
- Real GDP was 9.1% lower in Q2 2020 relative to Q4 2019
