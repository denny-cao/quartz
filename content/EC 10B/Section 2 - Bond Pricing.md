# Overview and Review
- Macroeconomic fluctuations and how monetary policy can be used to mitigate their negative effects
- First need to understand financial system (interest rates, how they are determined)
- Interest rates can be used to calculate the future value of dollars today and the present value of payments in the future 
	- Ex. Financial securities that pay out $D per year forever, where $D grows annually at rate g 
# Financial Securities
Contracts that have value because **they promise payment in the future**. Can be bought/sold in markets.
- Bonds and Stocks
Bonds and bond markets are important to understanding monetary and fiscal policy
# Bonds and the Bond Market
## Bonds
**Contract that promises a known schedule of fixed (nominal) payments to be made in the future**.
- By selling a bond, **issuer gets money now** and **commits to repaying in the future (with interest)**
## Bond Market Terminology
**Issuer**: Entity promising to make the bond's payments
**Bondholder**: Entity entitled to the bond's payments
**Maturity/Term**: Time until the bond's final payment
**Face Value**: Value of the bond's final payment
**Coupon**: Intermediate payment made by a bond
- Coupon paid on final payment as well
**Coupon Rate**: Coupon amount expressed as a fraction of the bond's face value
## The Bond Market
**Primary Market**: Firms or governments issue bonds, sell them to bondholders
**Secondary Market**: Bondholders sell their bonds to other bondholders, who the receive all remaining payments from issuers

**The volume of transactions in the secondary market is much larger than the volume of primary issuances**.
# Bond Prices and Interest Rates
## Bond Worth
- Bonds have a **market price** at which they are bought and sold in secondary markets
- For a bond with no coupon payments, face value $\$ F$, and maturity $T$, the present value $\$X$ at interest rate $i$ is:
$$
X = \frac{F}{(1+i)^T}
$$
## Market Interest Rates
Equates the **current price** of the bond with the **present value of the stream of future payments**.
- Reflects the constant annual rate of return that an investor would earn from buying a bond and holding it until it matures if the bond makes all of its promised payments
- The cost of new borrowing for the bond issuer
## Interest Rates and the Bond Prices are Two Sides of the Same Coin
$$
p = \frac{F}{(1+i)^T}
$$
- Interest rates and prices are simultaneously determined in bond markets
	- Fundamentally linked by pricing equation
- Schedule Only schedule of payments is contractually specified in advance
## Bond prices and interest rates are inversely related
- If $p$ rises, $i$ must fall; if $i$ rises, $p$ must fall
- Intuition: When a bonds price goes up, you still get the same face value and coupon payments. This means that the rate of return on your investment goes down because it costs you more to buy the same future payment stream

**We sometimes distinguish between the current market interest rate and the interest rate when a bond was first issued (interest rate at origination)**
## Bonds with Coupons
The **market interest rate** equates the **current price** of the bond with the **present value of the stream of future payments**.
- $y$ year maturity bond with face value $F$ and coupon rate $c$:
$$
p = \frac{F}{(1+i)^y}  + \sum_{T=1}^{y}\frac{cF}{(1+i)^T}
$$
- Discount the cash flow every year
# Equilibrium in the Bond Market
## Arbitrage: Buy Low, Sell High, Make Money
If the same asset trades at different prices, you profit by buying in the cheap market and selling in the expensive market 
- In well-functioning financial market w/o frictional cost, supply and demand will work to remove the price differential
- Exploiting an arbitrage opportunity eliminates it: Buying raises the low $P$; selling lowers the high $p$
# Equilibrium in the Bond Market
- In equilibrium there are no arbitrage opportunities: **bonds with similar characteristics offer investors the same $i$**
- Not all bonds have similar characteristics; for some bonds investors demand a **premium**, extra return as compensation for holding a bond with those characteristics (eg. **risk**, **maturity**)
## Interest Rates and the Risk of Default
- In equilibrium, bonds with similar risk have similar yields (due to arbitrage)
## Shape of the Yield Curve
- Shape of the yield curve reflects expectations of future interest rates
- Loosely speaking, think of long-term bond as like a series of consecutive short-term bonds
	- If short-term rates expected to rise, long-term rate will be higher than current short-term rate
	- If short-term rates expected to fall, long-term rate will be lower than current short-term rate
