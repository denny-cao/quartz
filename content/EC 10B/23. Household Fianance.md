# Risk and Return
## Risky Rates of Return
$$
Z(1+r)^T
$$
- Consider world where rate of return is more variable, compute expected return based on probability 
- Process has no memory

## Distribution of Outcomes: Percentiles
The $N$th percentile is a cutoff that divides the data so that $N\%$ of the data is below the cutoff and $(100-N)\%$ is above

## Diversification
- Picking a large portfolio of stocks reduces risk
- Dividing your financial wealth across many different investments is called **diversification**

## Risk Aversion
- Being risk averse implies you prefer a sure thing over a risky payout with the same expected value as the sure thing
## Why should you be risk averse?
- You can get **paid** to take risk in asset markets, so don't take risk for free
	- Historically, stocks have had a real (inflation-adjusted) annual return of 7%
	- Looking forward over the long-run, economists expect stocks to have a real (inflation-adjusted) annual return of 6%
	- The "risk-free" real return is close to 0%. So you get paid to take risk by investing in the stock market rather than investing in risk-free assets
## How does diversification help reduce risk?

Suppose you and the other investor pooled your investments (and share the proceeds)

# Financial Investment
## Stocks and Bonds
**Shares** are ownership rights in a corporation.
**Shares, stocks, and equity** are used interchangeably. Share values never go negative, because corporations are organized on a **limited liability** basis. If a corporation becomes illiquid or insolvent, then the corporation goes into bankruptcy. Shareholders are not personally responsible for paying a corporation's debts
## Mutual Funds and ETFs
**Mutual fund** or **ETF** (exchange traded fund) is a pool of money that is collected from many investors. These funds typically invest in stocks, bonds, and/or short-term money market instruments
- Professionally managed. To pay managers and other admin costs, funds charge an annual fee: the **expense** ratio
- These funds are not reported on the quarterly statements of the fund, but the fees are reported in the funds' prospectus
- A typical annual fee is 1% of the assets under management, but fees range from 0% per year to over 2% per year
- Some mutual funds also charge a front-end load (paid when purchased) or a back-end load (paid when sold)
## Retirement Savings
Retirement savings in the US come in four forms:
- **Social Security**: Required contribution during your entire working life (you and your employer each contribute 6.2% of your pre-tax labor income, up to a cap of 168,600 for 2024)
	- Average monthly SS benefit for retired workers is $1,905 in Dec. 2023

- 2035 exhausted
- **Defined contribution (DC workplace pension) accounts**
	- Individual account
	- E.g., 401(k), 403(b), 457, Thrift Savings Plan
	- Employees make annual contributions capped at $23,000
	- Most workers contribute 5% to 10% of annual income
	- Most large employers "match" contributions
	- Can allocate savings across different asset classes
	- A common investment: Target Date Retirement Funds
- **Defined Benefit (DB workplace pension) accounts**
	- Employer provides a stream of guaranteed payments after you retire and until you die (annuity)
	- For your generation, relevant mostly outside US
- **Individual retirement accounts (IRAs and Rollver IRAs)**
	- Another individual account (like defined contribution plans)
	- Defined contribution accounts are rolled over to IRAs when you "separate" from your employer
	- Workers who are employed by small companies or are self-employed, may not have a DB or DC plan at work. These employees directly contribute to their own IRA
