# Forward Time Machine: Future Value
## Terminology
**Intertemporal Transformation**: Move resources between time periods
- Saving money today and then spending it $T$ years from now is an intertemporal transformation
- If you save $\$ Z$ today and you earn an annual nominal rate of return $i$, you can withdraw $Z \times (1+i)^T$ after $T$ years
- "Inter": Between
- "Temporal": Time
## Compound Interest
Get interest on your interest (Not just on principle)
$$
P(1+i)^T
$$
## Inflation
- If annual inflation rate is $\pi\%$, then the same basket of goods and services costs $\pi\%$ more one year
- 3.4% Inflation rate in 2023, elevated above 2%
## Real Rate of Return
If **nominal rate of return** $i$ and inflation rate is $\pi$ then **real rate of return** is
$$
r=i-\pi
$$
- Real rate of return tells us how much the buying power of our savings grows over time
## Payday Loans
- Pay interest rate on a **two-week** interest rate v. annual for typical debt
### Should we ban loans with high interest rates?
- Should "payday" loans be illegal?
- No payday loans for members of armed forces (Military Lending Act)
### Alternative: Pawn Shop
- Use collateral: Give something worth more than loan, pay back loan + interest and if not, pawned off for more
## Future Value Calculations
- **Future Value** of a stream of payments is amount of money that you will accumulate by some time in the future
$$
P\left(\sum_{i=1}^T(1+r)^i\right)
$$
# Backward Time Machine: Present Value
## Present Value (PV)
- Money in the future worth less than money today because that money can be used to invest to generate more
## Definiton
**Present Value** of a future payment is amount of money that would need to be invested today to produce that future payment
- Present value is the **discounted** value of the future
$$
PV = \frac{\text{Payment }T \text{ periods from now}}{(1+r)^T}
$$
- Discount factor: $$
\frac{1}{(1+r)^T}
$$
## Net Present Value (NPV)
NPV of a project is the sum of all costs and benefits associated with a project, using PV to make the costs and benefits comparable
- Summary: Pursue projects with positive NPV and reject projects with negative NPV
## Opportunity Cost
- What is the opportunity cost of accepting an offer to invest $10,000 in the business?
	- Generates payoff of $20,000 in 20 years
- Give up alternative option: Spend $2,462 on immediate consumption and invest the rest at a 5% rate of return
	- Also generates $20,000 in 20 years and also immediate spending
## Quick Introduction to Stock Market
- Stock (or share) of a company is a proportionate claim to the company's dividends (and proportionate voting rights in elections for the board of directors)
- If you have 1 share in a company with 10 shares, then you have a right to 1/10th of the company's dividends and 1/10th of the voting rights
## Using PV to Price Stocks (and Bonds)
- Share w/annual dividend
- Dividend starts at value $\$D$ next year and grows at rate $g$ every year forever
- Discount that stream of dividends with an interest rate of $i$
- What is PV of that stream of dividends?
$$
P = \sum_{k=1}^T\frac{D(1+g)^{k-1}}{(1+i)^k}=\frac{D}{i-g}
$$
- We discount future dividends, so it will approach a value

# Time Preferences (Present Bias) v. Interest Rates
- People act as if they value future utility less than present utility
- Economists and psychologists refer to the discounting of future utility as **time preferences**
- Economists distinguish between
	- **Money** discounting which uses interest rates $\frac{1}{(1+i)^T}$
	- **Utility** discounting which uses psychological weights (EC 10a)

# Balance Sheets of US Households
## Financial Wealth Accumulation
- **Actual** median value of net financial assets for households aged 61-70: $36,942
- **Net Financial Assets** is all financial assets minus credit-card debt
## Reasons
- 50% of US firms offer retirement savings accounts
- 50% of savings leaks out of these accounts pre-retirement
- 65% of workers who are eligible to participate, do so
- Among those workers who do participate, contribution rate is approximately 7% not 9% (partly reflects less employer matching)
- Households are employed/eligible/vested 80% of the time from age 21-70 (education, disability, unemployment spells, etc.)
- Households also hold some debt (excluding mortgage and car debt, which are collateralized debts and hence excluded from the net financial worth calculation)
- $36,942 is for age group 61-70. Would be a bit higher if we focused on households "aged" 71.
# Savings Policy and Paternalism
## Societal Efforts to Raise Retirement Resources
- Auto-enrollment in retirement savings plans
	- Auto-enrollment at a 3% saving rate (with a 50% employer match)
	- Also auto-escalation
	- With Secure 2.0 legislation, auto-enrollment for rainy day saving
- Defined benefit pension
- Government savings incentives
	- Saver's Credit: Savings match of 50%, 20%, 10%, or 0% depending on level of income. Credit caps out at $1000 per capita
- Social Security (Mandatory Savings)
	- Households with median income, SS replaces slightly less than half of their pre-retirement income
	- SS tax is 12.4% of income (Up to $168,600 in 2024)
	- Reduced poverty amongst elderly
- Medicare (partially pre-paid and heavily subsidized health insurance)
	- About 75% of medical costs after age 65 are paid by the government
	- Medicare tax is 2.9% of your income (paid during working life)
