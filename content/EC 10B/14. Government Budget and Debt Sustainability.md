# Fiscal Facts and Outlook
![[Pasted image 20240324180209.png]]
- Difference between the two is deficit
![[Pasted image 20240324180300.png]]
- Gets money in the deficit by borrowing; borrowing more money than previous year
![[Pasted image 20240324180352.png]]
- GDP gives sense of capacity to repay debt (income of the government)
- Can lower debt relative to economy even when running a budget deficit by GDP increasing more than debt
- Debt lowered drastically WW2: GDP increased far more
- A lot of debt incurred during financial crisis and COVID
- Debt is projected to continue to rise (Different from after WW2)

- Intragovernmental holdings: Economists do not worry; internal accounting
- Fed: Buys debt in public market (not internal government), issued debt in reserves
- Government bonds (Private domestic)
![[Pasted image 20240324180927.png]]
- Peaked in 2010 and has fallen
- 2.5% of federal debt
- Red herring worrying about debt holding with China

# Debt Sustainability Analysis
![[Pasted image 20240324181952.png]]
- Where should debt be stable at?
	- Debt sustainability analysis does not analysis this, need to bring in other considerations
$$
\text{Deficit}_t = \text{Government Spending}_t - \text{Taxes}_t
$$
$$
\text{Primary Deficit}_t = \text{Government spending excl. interest}_t - \text{Taxes}_t
$$
$$
\text{Deficit} = \text{Primary Deficit}_t + \text{Interest}_t
$$
**We will define a deficit as positive and a surplus as negative.**
## Dynamics of the debt
$$
\text{Debt}_t = \text{Debt}_{t-1} + \text{Deficit}_t
$$
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Debt}_t &= \text{Debt}_{t-1} + \text{Interest}_t + \text{Primary Deficit}_t \\
&= \text{Debt}_{t-1} + i(\text{Debt}_{t-1}) + \text{Primary Deficit}_t \\
&= (1+i_t)\text{Debt}_{t-1} + \text{Primary Deficit}_t
\end{align}
$$
## Case 1 w/Primary Balanced Budget: Debt as a share of GDP dynamics
A primary balanced budget means $\text{Primary Deficit} = 0$
- Debt grows at rate $i$ (Nominal interest rate):
$$
\text{Debt}_t = (1+i)\text{Debt}_{t-1}
$$
- GDP grows at rate $g$ (Nominal growth rate):
$$
\text{GDP}_t = (1+g)\text{GDP}_{t-1}
$$
- If $i = g$, then ratio stays constant
- If $i > g$, then ratio increases
- If $i < g$, then ratio decreases
We then can generalize when primary deficit is 0:
$$
\text{Debt}_t - \text{Debt}_{t-1} = i_t \times \text{Debt}_{t-1}
$$
$$
\left(\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{GDP}}\right)_t - \left(\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{GDP}}\right)_{t-1} \approx (i_t - g_t) \left(\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{GDP}}\right)_{t-1}
$$
- Formula also works with the real interest rate and the real growth rate because inflation cancels out
## Case 2: Primary deficit is not zero
$$
\text{Debt}_t - \text{Debt}_{t-1} = i_t(\text{Debt}_{t-1}) + \text{Primary Deficit}_t
$$
$$
\left(\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{GDP}}\right)_t - \left(\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{GDP}}\right)_{t-1} \approx (i_t - g_t) \left(\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{GDP}}\right)_{t-1} + \left(\frac{\text{Primary Deficit}}{\text{GDP}}\right)_t
$$
- If $i=g$, then add the primary deficit to GDP ratio each year: Debt to GDP ratio will eventually spiral to infinity 
- If $i > g$, then will eventually spiral to infinity even faster
- If $i < g$, then will eventually stabilize for any finite primary deficit
## Factors that make the debt rise more as a share of GDP
- **Larger primary deficit**. This is the gap between non-interest spending and taxes. Larger primary deficits increase the debt faster.
- **Higher $i$ relative to $g$.** The higher the interest rate is relative tot he growth rate, the faster debt will rise as a share of the economy. Intuitively:
	- A higher interest rate means that the debt will grow faster (in levels)
	- A higher growth rate means that the debt (in levels) will shrink faster as a share of the economy
	- If these are equal these two effects cancel out, and the added interest = added growth and the debt/GDP will be stable absent a primary deficit
- The higher the initial debt/GDP, the more (i-g) matters relative to the primary deficit
- 4% IR and GR average for US
	- Forecast: 3.5% IR and 4% GR, so US can run a primary deficit
## What is required for debt to be stable as a share of GDP?
Set the left hand side to be 0 to get:
$$
\frac{\text{Primary Deficit}}{\text{GDP}} \approx (g-i) \frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{GDP}}
$$
## Is $g>i$ really a license to run an unlimited primary deficit?
Assumes $i$ and $g$ are fixed. In reality, they would change when debt changes. If the debt went to 200% of GDP it is likely that $g$ would fall (due to crowd out) and $i$ would rise (same reason plus investor risk perceptions increasing).
# Debt Crises and Defaults
## Public debt default
A country defaults on its debt if:
- It has expenditures that exceed revenue and it is unable to borrow the difference
- It has debt that comes due and it cannot "roll it over" by borrowing more debt
**Default is more likely (and more severe) for countries that borrow in a foreign currency. This includes many emerging and developing economies and also the members of the euro area.**
![[Pasted image 20240324190454.png]]
- Emerging markets (even developed) are worried about this
![[Pasted image 20240324190538.png]]
## Largest Sovereign Default in History: Argentina in 2001
- Argentina entered a severe recession in 1998 with GDP falling 8% in 3 years. Eventually there was. a major bank run as people tried to get US dollars for the Argentine pesos they were holding. Riots followed killing 39 people.
- On December 23, 2001, Argentina defaulted on $93 billion of debt. Most borrowers were eventually paid about $0.30 for every $1 of debt they held.
- The economy contracted another 11% in 2002. The Argentine peso lost 75% of its value, inflation jumped to 40%, poverty rate rose to 50%, foreign investment in Argentina stopped for several years, and it was unable to borrow again for 15 years.
## Some other large sovereign debt defaults
**Mexico (1982):** Stopped paying interest on $86 billion of debt. Several other Latin American countries ended up following in the debt crisis that the US, the International Monetary Fund, other countries and private banks spent much of the decade grappling with. (America raised interest rates to fight inflation which made Mexican rates go up)
**Russia (1998):** Russia suffered a massive economic crisis which led it to default on its foreign debt. It was accompanied by bank runs, a currency crisis, a severe recession and inflation.
**Greece (2010):** Borrowed 180% of GDP. Multiple rounds of partial default on its debt, got a total $172 billion bailout, its problems spread to other countries in the "Eurozone crisis." Entered a Great Depression-like collapse it still has not recovered from.
**Sri Lanka (2022):** Failed to make $78 million payment on unpaid interest payments. Seeking to restructure $50 billion in foreign debt. Accompanied by high inflation, falling foreign reserves and currency devaluation.
## Can it happen in the US?
**The United States borrows in its own currency and controls its own monetary policy.** Technically, US never needs to default on its debt because the Fed can buy the debt and issue reserves. The reserves could be used to pay for government spending.

**How big of a difference is this?**
- Lead to high and rising inflation, eventually a hyperinflation
- This would de facto be a default on the debt (i.e., if the government borrows $100 and prices go up 100% then it is like it defaulted on 50% of its debt)

**At what level of debt would investors lose confidence in the US?**
- No one knows. 
# Alternative Fiscal Goals and Rules
## What fiscal goal? Should it be a rule?
**Eliminate debt**: No one advocates for this.
**Balanced unified budget** (adjusted for the business cycle): Germany and some other countries have this goal. It has relatively little support among mainstream economists.
**Stabilize the debt**: This is a widely shared goal, but it gets the question of what value to stabilize the debt at. Its current value? Some target, like the euro area target of 60% of GDP? A moderately declining or moderately increasing path?
**Stabilize debt payments**: A more recent proposal (e.g., keep real debt service below 2% of GDP). It addresses the way changing interest rates change fiscal goals but has the problem of unpredictable and sometimes large changes in interest rates.
![[Pasted image 20240324211105.png]]
## A stronger case for tighter fiscal goals and more enforceable rules if:
- A country borrows in a foreign currency
- A country lacks credibility, e.g., due to past high inflations or defaults
- A country does not have credible tax or spending plans
- A country has greater future obligations (e.g., public pension promises)
- A country does not have the world's reserve currency (i.e., the country is not the US)
