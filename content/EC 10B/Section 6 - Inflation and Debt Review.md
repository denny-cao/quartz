# Phillips Curve
**Key Question**: Do changes in demand affect prices, output, or both?
$$
\pi = \pi^e + f(\text{UR} - \text{NR}) + \text{SS}
$$
$\pi^e$: Expected inflation
$f(0)=0$, and is a strictly increasing function
$\text{UR}$: Unemployment rate
$\text{NR}$: Natural rate
$\text{SS}$: Supply shock
**Key Intuitions**
- Healthy economy
	- UR at NR since at potential, and no supply shocks, then inflation will be at expected inflation
	- Inflationary pressures arise when the unemployment rate falls below its natural rate ($\pi > \pi^e$)
Equilibrium at natural unemployment rate and inflation that the Fed is targeting
- Left of the curve (Inflation is higher, unemployment lower): Tight labor market
- Right of curve (Inflation is lower, unemployment is higher): Loose labor market
Unemployment rate will result in movements along the curve. Unemployment rate is affected by **demand shocks**

Expected inflation and supply shocks will result in shift of the curve

Policymakers "run the economy hot" by keeping unemployment below its natural rate (expansionary policy)
- This will increase expectation of inflation
- Death spiral of constantly increasing inflation
# Phillips Curve and Disinflation
Contractionary policy but expectations remain the same with a shifted Phillips curve, would have to reduce employment by a lot to achieve a desired inflation rate (Hard landing)

Need to do a lot of tightening in order to reduce expectations to get curve back for contractionary policy to keep unemployment rate the same... Then don't need to do as much contractionary policy, resulting in being able to get to target IR, but way less additional UR (Soft landing)

Over time, with high UR, with correct IR, will slowly shift UR to NR

## Did Fed Make a Mistake?
- Lowering inflation expectations is difficult and uncertain
	- Attempts to do this w/words and actions
	- By taking a strong position, it may not need to tighten as much
- What is the risk of doing too little?
	- Phillips curve continues to shift, causing inflation to rise (To keep same inflation, must increase UR higher and higher)
	- Stagflation: Both inflation is high and going up, unemployment rate is high and going up (Fed's goal to avoid: Both mandates not fulfilled)
# Debt Sustainability
**NOT** reducing debt to zero
**NOT** keeping debt below a certain nominal amount
Government can continuously run budget deficits and accumulate nominal debt and still have its debt be sustainable
- Governments can "roll over" their debt by borrowing to make payments on existing debt
- A given nominal debt is les burdensome when the size of the economy is larger
$$
\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{GDP}}=\text{const}
$$
Debt sustainability is about keeping debt at a **stable share of GDP over time**
- Caveat: High levels of debt may drive up borrowing costs, crowd out private investment, and increase the risk of a fiscal crisis
Government can sustain persistent budget deficits as long as the economy is growing fast enough relative to its interest payments
- A higher interest rate $i$ makes debt grow more quickly
- Faster nominal GDP growth $g$ reduces burden of a given debt level
Larger economy = More money to pay off
# Debt Evolution
$$
\left(\frac{D}{G}\right)_t - \left(\frac{D}{G}\right)_{t-1} \approx (i_t - g_t)\left(\frac{D}{G}\right)_{t-1} + \left(\frac{PD}{G}\right)_t$$
- $D$: Debt
- $G$: GDP
- $PD$: Primary deficit
- $g$: Growth rate of GDP

## Debt Stability
When debt is stable:
$$
\frac{PR}{G} = (g-i)\frac{D}{G}
$$
Spring 2023 Final Exam Q50
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{Overall deficit}}{\text{GDP}} &= \frac{\text{Primary deficit}}{\text{GDP}} + \frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{GDP}} \\
0.04 &= \frac{PI}{G}+(I \times \frac{Debt}{G}) \\
0.04 - 0.025 &= \frac{PI}G{}\\
0.015 &= \\
(\frac{D}{G})_t - (\frac{D}{G})_{t-1} &= (0.05 - 0.07) \times 0.05 + 0.015 \\
&> 0
\end{align*}
$$
Thus debt/GDP is increasing
Debt is increasing
