# Global Inequality
## Global Income Distribution
![[Pasted image 20240413130549.png]]
## Sources of Global Inequality
- **Inequality within countries:** You could be someone who is poor or rich relative to others within the US or someone who is poor or rich relative to others within Ghana. (Focus in Ec 10a)
- **Inequality between countries:** You could be someone living in a rich country (ex. US on average is rich) or someone living in a poor country (ex. Ghana on average is poor). (Focus in Ec 10b)
## What country you live in matters somewhat more than where you rank in that country

## Global income inequality falling since 2000
![[Pasted image 20240413131253.png]]
- Reflects a reduction in **between country** inequality (weighted by population), particularly China and India
- Inequality **within countries** has generally been flat or rising over this period.
# Comparing Countries
## Some ways to scale GDP to compare countries
$$
\text{GDP}
$$
- Measures how powerful country is with aggregate GDP
$$
\text{GDP per capita} = \frac{\text{GDP}}{\text{Population}}
$$
- also called "per capita income"
- How rich people are is with per capita GDP
$$
\text{GDP per worker} = \frac{\text{GDP}}{\text{Workers}}
$$
- also called "per worker income"
- Useful for viewing how productive capacities differ between countries
$$
\text{GDP per hour worked} = \frac{\text{GDP}}{\text{Total hours worked}}
$$
- Also called "labor productivity"
- How productive workers are

![[Pasted image 20240413132044.png]]
- Even though GDP/hour is similar, US workers work more hours, so then more GDP/capita
## Making different currencies comparable: Market exchange rates
Can compare by using **market exchange rates.** Exchange foreign currency to domestic currency and compare

**The problem with using market exchange rates is that many items and services have different prices in different places.**
## Making different currencies comparable: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
**Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** compares how much it costs to buy a fixed basket of consumer goods in India to the United States (analogous to how the CPI compares the cost of a basket across years in a single country)
- More accurate way to compare standard of living of different people across countries
- China PPP is greater than US and lower with market exchanges (Global power: market exchange rates matter more)

# Aggregate Production Function
## Ingredient 1: Capital (K)
- **Capital Equipment**: (Tractors, machines, computers). Physical things that help with production
- **Capital Structures**: (Factories, warehouses).
- **Investment** is flow, **capital** is stock
## Ingredient 2: Labor (H)
$$
H \equiv L \times h
$$
- $H$: **Total Efficiency Units of Labor.** Also called human capital, and we often shorthand it as labor
- $L$:  **Total Number of Workers.** (Strictly speaking, would want the total hours of work)
- $h$: **Average Human Capital Efficiency of Workers.** An economic concept that is not readily measurable/observable but reflects the fact that some workers produce more per hour than other workers
	- In practice, measure by average years of schooling
## Combining capital and labor to produce output
![[Pasted image 20240413134348.png]]
- This is called **constant returns to scale in capital and labor:** If you double *both* capital and labor then output doubles
## What if firm just adds capital?
![[Pasted image 20240413134523.png]]
- This is called **diminishing returns to scale in capital:** Each unit of capital adds less to output than the last
## Diminishing marginal product of capital (MPK)
![[Pasted image 20240413134649.png]]
## Also diminishing returns to labor
![[Pasted image 20240413134709.png]]
- This is called **diminishing returns to scale in labor:** Each unit of labor adds less to output than the last
## Example function
$$
\text{Tax returns} = 10 \sqrt{\text{Accountants} \times \text{Calculators}}
$$
## Ingredient 3: Technology (A)
![[Pasted image 20240413134930.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240413134956.png]]
- Technology is a multiplicative term
## Generalizing to Aggregate Production Function
$$
Y \equiv A \times F(K,H)
$$
- Identity because we can define $A$ to be anything that makes equality hold
- Properties of aggregate production function:
	- Constant returns to scale in capital and labor
	- Diminishing returns to scale in capital
	- Diminishing returns to scale in labor
$sY = A\times F(sK,sH), \forall s > 0$ and the first derivative of $F$ in $K$ or $H$ are positive and the second derivative in $K$ or $H$ are negative.
## Some specific functional forms for $F(K,H)$ you may see
Simple version for problem sets:
$$
Y = A \times \sqrt{K \times H}
$$
More realistic version used by economists:
$$
Y = A \times K^{\frac{1}{3}} \times H^{\frac{2}{3}}
$$
## Can also express production function in per worker terms
$$
Y \equiv A \times F(K, h \times L)
$$
Divide both sides by $L$. Because it is constant returns to scale you can divide both arguments of the function by $L$:
$$
\left(\frac{Y}{L}\right) \equiv A \times F \left(\frac{K}{L}, h\right)
$$
- $\frac{Y}{L}$: **Labor productivity** and also called "output per worker" or "output per hour."
## Ways to increase output
- **More capital**: Higher investment, for example encouraging businesses to invest more in equipment or the government investing more in roads and bridges ($K \uparrow$)
- **More labor**: Longer workdays, higher employment rates or faster population growth ($L \uparrow$)
- **More skilled labor**: Better education or training ($h \uparrow$)
- **Better technology:** ($A \uparrow$)
# Technology
## Technology or Total Factor Productivity (TFP) or Solow Residual
Technological increases allow an economy to produce more for a given amount of capital (K) and efficiency units of labor (H). It includes:
- **Knowledge**
	- R&D
	- Learning by doing
- **Efficiency of production**
	- Management practices
	- Institutions/culture/norms
	- Allocation of people/capital to highest value uses
- In practice $A$ is calculated as a residual after accounting for everything observable. "A measure of our ignorance."
## What are some of the big ways technology has increased since 1950 in the US?
## Huge estimated effect of reducing discrimination

- Talent spread evenly amongst people... If only choose one subgroup, miss out on enormous talent. Reduce -> More market output growth

![[Pasted image 20240413143710.png]]
- $K$: Measure how much capital added each year, and then subtract estimate of how much wears out

## Two Messages From These Data
- Big differences between countries today are due to technology (or total factor productivity)
- Although poorer countries have much less physical capital and human capital than richer countries, this does not matter nearly as much because:
	- Diminishing marginal product from more physical/human capital
	- Marginal product of physical/human capital is relatively low if TFP is low
## Why is technology so different today?
In case of India, one factor historically that economists have documented is substantial **misallocation** of capital and labor due to:
- License requirements to start a new business
- Employment laws that make it harder to grow
- Protections for existing firms, even if they are inefficient
- Limits on foreign investments and trade
Many of these have been reformed in recent years and TFP growth has picked up

Many other factors are at work.
## Why has this difference grown so much---and why has it started to narrow?
