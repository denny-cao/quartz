# Three Categories of Policy
- **Monetary Policy**: Policies implemented by the **Federal Reserve Bank** independently of Congress and the Executive (Decision making resides with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the larger Federal Open Market Committee, both led by Jerome Powell)
- **Fiscal Policy**: Purchases, loans, and transfers legislated by Congress, signed by the Executive, and implemented by the Executive (Especially the Treasury Department, which is now led by Janet Yellen)
- **Hybrid Policies**: Involve some sort of cooperation between monetary authority, Congress, and the Executive
	- Examples: Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), CARES act, Bank term Funding Program
