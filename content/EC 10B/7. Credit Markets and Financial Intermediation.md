# Overview of the Financial System
## World without financial institutions or markets
- **No** financial institutions, then keep savings hidden
- **No** financial institutions or markets, no bank to lend funds to buy house (mortgage)
## Intermediaries
Connect those with funds they want to save/invest/give to those who need funds
- Can use to deploy funds, and on the other side of that transaction:
	- Bank: Make a deposit that you can withdraw any time (Those looking for loans)
	- Investment Company: Buy stocks and bonds and other financial securities and then sell at any time (Those saving for retirement)
	- Philanthropic organization (Donor and recipients)
## Financial Securities that are Bought and Sold in Markets
- **Stocks (or equity**. Fractional ownership of a company
	- Shareholder gets a vote in company decisions (by electing board of directors) and gets a fraction of the dividends 
		- Global stocks total about $109 trillion in 2023
- **Bonds (debt)**. A company borrows a fixed amount, commits to make periodic fixed **coupon** payments, and ultimately repaying the **face value**.
	- Global bonds total about $136 trillion in 2023. The majority of bonds are issued by governments. Businesses and households (through pooled mortgages and other debts) are also large issuers
## Four Roles of the Financial System
- **Financial Intermediation**. Links someones need for savings, with someones need for capital.
	- Bernie Madoff stole $65 billion of savings; FTX lost/stole $10 billion of savings
- **Payments**. Transactions between two parties (Venmo, Zelle, etc.)
	- Citibank mistakenly wires $893 million to a group of investment firms
- **Risk reduction**. Can reduce risk by allowing agents to hedge risks (ex. insurance, diversification)
	- Sometimes financial system is source of systemic risk (Lehman Brothers)
- **Price discovery**. Asset market trading determines the fundamental value of companies ensuring that capital is allocated efficiently.

# Financing Start-Ups: Spotlight on Venture Capital
2021: $621 billion in funding to "start-ups"
# However, most venture investments don't well
- Most failures are simple: idea doesn't work -> nothing
- But some failures are far more complex
- Theranos: A blood-testing company funded by VC valued at $9 billion 2014
	- Summer 2016: Worthless and under investigation
	- 1/3/2022: Guilty on 4 counts
# Bank's Interrelated Roles as Financial Intermediaries
1. Identify profitable lending opportunities
2. Transform short-term liabilities into long-term investments (maturity transformation)
3. Manage and transfer risk
## Profitable Lending Opportunities
- Attract a large number of potential borrowers
- Identity the best loan applications among them
### Red-Lining
**Fair Housing Act (1968)** prohibits discrimination in housing financing, sales, and rentals
- Philadelphia: Government said not to loan in bad neighborhoods. Based on racial demographics of communities (Disproportionally black)
**Octavius Catto**: Fought for civil rights for black voters in Philadelphia
## Maturity Transformation
Banks transform short-maturity liabilities (deposits) into long-term investments (business and real estate loans, mortgages)
- Depositors can withdraw deposits at a moment's notice, but bank (normally) waits decades to get its mortgage loans repaid
## JP Morgan Chase 
- Liabilities (Short Run): Deposits of people (Can withdraw at moments notice)
- Assets (Long term investments, reserves, etc.)
- Amount owed is greater than amount raised in short run
	- This is the case because they have long term loans, etc.
- Total assets - Total liabilities = Total equity which is positive
