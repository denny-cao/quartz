# Lender of Last Resort (LOLR)
 **Lender of Last Resort**: A public institution that provides liquidity (e.g. loans) to the private firms that are unable to readily obtain liquidity from private lenders
 - EC10Bank would **not** have failed if it had been able to borrow money to make pay-outs instead of conducting destructive fire sales of its illiquid assets (which led to bankruptcy)
 - EC10Bank would have been saved if it had access to a LOLR, which could have used EC10Bank's illiquid assets as collateral for loans to EC10Bank
## When Fed says "LOLR":
- It means a loan on which the Fed can't take a loss, usually because the Fed has obtained "enough" collateral
- Federal law requires the Fed to only engage in lending that generates essentially no risk of losses to the **Fed**
- If there is prior agreement, losses can be legally borne by other parts of the government (e.g in the US the Department of the Treasury)
# Monetary, Fiscal, and Monetary/Fiscal Hybrid
## Three sources of funding during a financial crisis
- **Monetary Policy**: Loans implemented by the **Fed**, independently of Congress and the Executive (Decision making resides with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the larger Federal Open Market Committee)
	- Lending from the discount window of the Federal Reserve Board
- **Fiscal Policy**: Loans and grants legislated by Congress, signed by the Executive, and implemented by the Executive (especially the Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration)
- **Hybrid Policies**: Involve some sort of cooperation among the monetary authority, Congress, and the Executive:
	- Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)
	- 13 special purpose credit facilities in 2020
	- Bank Term Funding Program (2023)
# Troubled Asset Relief Program (2008)
- One of the key policies implemented during the 2007-2009 recession
- Contained many special funding mechanisms
- A **hybrid** policy because involved Congress, the Treasury, and the Fed
- In October 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 established TARP to promote stability in financial markets through the coordinated activities of the Treasury Department and the Fed
## Overview
- Total funding in legislation: $700 billion
	- $245 billion was "lending" to banks
- Total funding disbursed: $443 billion
- Total economic cost of TARP: $31 billion
- **Cost so little because almost all of the funds were repaid, typically with interest**
# Sources of Funding in 2020-21 (COVID Recession)
## LOLR monetary policies during the COVID crisis
Policies the Fed implements **on its own**
- Buying Treasury Securities
- Buying Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities
- Making loans to banks from the "discount window"
## LOLR hybrid policies during the COVID crisis
Policies the Fed implements in **cooperation** with Treasury
- The Fed has broad emergency lending authority "in unusual and exigent circumstances" 13(3) of Federal Reserve Act
- In 2007, the Fed used 13(3) for the first time since 1936
- In 2010, Congress passed Dodd -Frank, which imposed additional limits on use of 13(3)
	- **Secretary of the Treasury** must endorse a decision to invoke 13(3) lending authority
	- No insolvent company can receive 13(3) funding and the Fed should attempt to protect taxpayers from losses
	- 13(3) lending should have "broad-based eligibility" (ie. no program should target or restrict to a single company)
# Sources of Funding in 2023 (Banking Crisis)
## Policy Response
- FDIC guarantees all depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank (i.e extending deposit insurance above $250,000): "systemic risk exception" (3/12)
- Federal Reserve creates a new credit facility (Bank Term Funding Program or BTFP), enabling depository institutions to borrow (one-year loans) using collateral valued at par (i.e face value), rather than using market-to-market valuation (3/12)
	- Treasury Department contributes $25 billion to cover potential losses from the BTFP credit facility (3/12)
- Swiss National Bank lends Credit Suisse $54 billion (3/16)
- 12 US banks (Led by JP Morgan Chase) deposit $30 billion at First Republic Bank to try to stem the panic (3/16)
## Bank Failures and Capital Injections
- Regulators force sale of Credit Suisse (CS) to UBS (3/19), making transaction viable with: $109 billion line of credit at the Swiss National Bank; $17 billion by zeroing-out "AT1" CS convertible bonds; $5 billion by partially zeroing-out CS stockholders; $10.3 billion government backstop for losses in CS position unwinding (later declined by UBS)
- FDIC sells Signature bank to New York Community Bancorp (3/19); $2.9 billion cost to FDIC using Deposit Insurance Fund
- FDIC sells Silicon Valley Bank to First Citizens Bank (3/26); $20 billion cost to FDIC
- FDIC sells First Republic Bank to JP Morgan Chase (5/1); $15.6 billion cost to FDIC
