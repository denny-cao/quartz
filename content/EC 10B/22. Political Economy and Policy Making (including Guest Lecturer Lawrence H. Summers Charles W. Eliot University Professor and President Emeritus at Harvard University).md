Neutral interest rate is too high
- Dollar investment volume down after financial crisis -> Belief of low interest rates, high savings
- Situation changed... Physical stimulus absorbed huge volume of saving promoted investment
- Natural interest rate: Natural place where things cleared -> Higher
- Fed: Still using natural interest rate of 2.5% meaning very restrictive in policies, but economy is still growing fast and faster than potential. More jobs each month, inflation doesn't look like down to 2%
- Policy not restrictive... Very cautious of cutting back on interest rates
- Monetary policy: There is lag. Think about where system is going, not now
- Worry on Fed: Late to figure out interest rates. 
- Be careful acting like 3% is good enough because undermine credibility
Fiscal policy
- How do we know where debt needs to stabilize
- Higher debt more risk
- Forecasts too optimistic
- Borrowing -> Crowd out investment in the future -> Grow more slowly
- Economy is good right now; what could spark loss in confidence, can greatest debtor remain world's greatest power
Populism: closed economy, short run oriented policy, based on immediate impacts, not thinking about longer causal change
