# Labor Market Definitions
- US payrolls every end of month
	- These **net** numbers are dwarfed by **gross** numbers. Every quarter about 15 million jobs added and 14.2 million destroyed typically.
$$
\text{Employment Rate} = \frac{\text{Employed}}{\text{Population}}
$$
- US: Population is age 16+, not in Army, institutionalized, or incarcerated (Adult population)
- Employment rates aren't normatively obvious; people don't work for good reasons. Old age, children, etc.
- Successful society allows people to not work
$$
\text{Unemployment Rate} = \frac{\text{Unemployed}}{\text{Labor Force}}
$$
- **Unemployed**: Somebody who does not have a job but is actively looking for one
	- Last month, made some effort to get a job
	- Labor Force = Sum of employed and unemployed
	-  A little unemployment is good; don't want people taking the first available job that better matches skill/career advancement
	- High is bad, too low is also bad. Care about long term unemployment rate; most people are just unemployed for a few weeks
$$
\text{Labor Force Participation Rate} = \frac{\text{Labor Force}}{\text{Population}}
$$

- Blurry boundary between unemployed and out of labor force; some are unhappily retired because cannot find job
![[Pasted image 20240205094422.png]]
- Largely goes up and down because economy is bad when up, good when down
![[Pasted image 20240205094545.png]]
- Wiggle is most likely measurement error
- 1950s to late 1990s: Women and Baby boomer population entering work force, decrease from 90s to early 2000s: exiting workforce. Demographics big part (Not a reason to be worried)
- Nothing really happens during recessions v. unemployment rate (Labor force participation is structural; its about culture, institutions, demographics v. Unemployment moves due to business cycles)
![[Pasted image 20240205094813.png]]
- Employment population is both 
- Women and baby boomer enter, trend goes up, recession goes down, down when baby boomers leaving, up during expansion
- 61% right now
![[Pasted image 20240205095103.png]]
- Prime age sometimes used because not affected by who students are, how many retirees, and demography
- Some this is source of concern; higher employment rates for women in European countries w/childcare and paid leave and are lower in the US

- Trying to understand wha tis behind it
## How to Raise Employment Rates
Employment rate goes up if:
1. Unemployment rate goes down
	- Set of policies in recessions which are monetary are fiscal policies (Later in course)
2. Labor force participation rate goes up
	- Longer-term trend is due to this. Less men participating, women stagnating 
	- Some ideas:
		- Improve education, training, apprenticeships
		- Expand childcare and paid leave
		- Increase work incentives (expand funding, including eligibility for Earned Income Tax Credit)
		- Reduce work disincentives from other public programs
		- Broader issues: Criminal justice reform, immigration, racial justice

- Does not correspond well with income; issue in India not because unemployment is high. Issue is, even with a job, not making very much
## Unemployment rate statistics are less useful in developing and emerging economies (low and middle income)
- Hard to tell employed v. unemployed
- Informal sector makes it hard to measure and interpret unemployment rates
- The bigger issues in labor markets are often how effectively people are matched with jobs and what types of hours they have (problem is more often **underemployment** which is hard to define and measure, than **unemployment**)
# Sources of Unemployment
![[Pasted image 20240205095807.png]]
- Peaks of Spain: Eurozone crisis
- Valleys of Spain: Really good years in their economy
- Even when economy was good, employment rate was 8-9%
	- v. US this would be recession
	- v. Japan. Even in worst recessions, unemployment rate is not different from really good times in the US
## Some key unemployment terms (not mutually exclusive/additive)
**Frictional**: "Unemployment resulting from imperfect information about available jobs and from the time-consuming process of job search."
**Structural**: "When the quantity of labor supplied **persistently** exceeds the quantity of labor demanded. Wage rigidity is a key factor in creating such a persistent gap."
- Microeconomic rules and factors can be the source of the rigidity
**Natural Rate**: "The rate of unemployment around which a healthy economy fluctuates."
- Should not think of it as "healthy" or even "natural" but instead what cannot be persistently lowered using macroeconomic policy without triggering risking inflation
**Cyclical Unemployment**: Actual unemployment rate - natural rate (Differs from textbook)
## Big caveats on the nature rate of unemployment
Natural rate (or "full employment" or "NAIRU") can be thought of as the **equilibrium** rate of unemployment to which the economy tends to turn
- **It is very hard to know precisely what it is**.It can change a lot, both over time and across countries.
- **It is not actually "natural"**. Depends on **microeconomic** institutions and policies
- **If a country tries to lower unemployment below the natural rate without changing these microeconomic determinants, can get higher nominal wages and higher/rising inflation.** What happens to real wages is an open question
- **Another open question is how much room there is for labor force participation to improve, thus raising the employment-population ratio.**
- Think natural unemployment rate for US is 4%. Currently at 3.7%; some think wouldn't be bade if rose a little, some view the difference as negligible and measuring error
## Why might a country have more structural unemployment and a higher natural rate?
- **Overly rigid labor markets**. For example, if it is too costly to fire workers, firms will not want to hire them initially (Europe: Protection over being fired)
- **Insufficiently supportive labor markets**. Lack of paid leave, childcare, apprenticeship programs, job search assistance (US)
- **Less effective education**. Lower levels of educational attainment or education poorly suited to jobs.
- **Excessively high minimum wage or overly inflexible unions**. Empirical evidence debated, depends on details

# Supply and Demand in the Labor Market
![[Pasted image 20240205114359.png]]
- Vertical because, when wage goes up, more likely to work (substitution effect)
- Make so much money that you don't need to work as much 
- Aggregate: Sometimes run out of aggregate labor; constraint
## What shifts labor demand and supply curves out?
**Labor Demand**
- Prices for good or service sold rise
- Demand for the good or service rises
- Changing technology **could raise or lower labor demand**
- Input prices fall
**Labor Supply**
- Workers' tastes shift towards more work
- Falling opportunity cost of time spent working
- Increased population
## Key to understanding labor markets in macroeconomics: nominal v. real wages
**Nominal Wage**: Wage measured in a currency. Can only lower this by reducing someone's paycheck.
**Real Wage**: Wages adjusted for inflation. Can lower this by reducing someone's paycheck OR by keeping paycheck the same if prices are rising (if inflation is rising)
## Evidence that nominal wages are downwardly rigid
![[Pasted image 20240205115020.png]]
- Easier to fire than lower wages for people.
- Hire new people at lower pay, but difficult because now multiple people different wages

## Hot economy or an overheating economy?

# Labor Market Fluctuations and GDP Fluctuations
## Supply and Demand Perspectives on the Economy
**Supply View**
$$
Y = f(\text{Capital}, \text{Workers}, \text{Technology})
$$
**Demand View**
$$
Y \equiv C + I + G + (X-M)
$$
Can analyze economic fluctuations from either perspective. We can think of a downturn as capital and workers going down (eg. because people are unemployed and factories are idle). Or we can think of a downturn as people and businesses spending less (C and I) down
![[Pasted image 20240205115932.png]]
## Labor Market Links the Demand and Supply Sides of the Economy
- When $C, I, G,$ or $(X-M)$ go down then labor demand goes down and the amount of workers goes down
- Similarly, the amount of factory utilization goes down
## Okun's Law: Movements in Unemployment Rate Closely Linked to Movements in Output
![[Pasted image 20240205120247.png]]
$$
\text{GDP Growth} = 3.3\% - 2.1 \times \Delta \text{Unemployment Rate}
$$
- Reflects both direct and indirect effects of change in unemployment on GDP

# What is Going on With the Labor Market Now?
## Rise and Fall of the US Unemployment Rate
![[Pasted image 20240205120624.png]]
- Long periods of stability are rare; reopening jobs + give money to still go to restaurants etc
## Fall and Rise of Labor Force Participation (Now roughly on pre-pandemic trend)
![[Pasted image 20240205120659.png]]
- Unemployment benefits gave better benefits than working
- Jumped back up, but took awhile
	- Where Are All the Missing Workers?
## Labor Market has "cooled" with reduced job openings but not higher unemployment
![[Pasted image 20240205120855.png]]
- Unemployment rate never rose, but inflation rate rose
- Number of job openings went down, unemployment stay about the same rather than people losing jobs with the disconnect of supply and demand
- Labor market has cooled in a pleasant way
## Nominal wage growth has been much higher than pre-pandemic, real wage growth has varied
