# Trade Deficit Myths
## 1. A trade surplus is not automatically good and a trade deficit is not automatically bad
- Imports are the benefit of trade; exports are the cost of trade
	- Benefit from the consumption of imports; more variety
	- Exports are costs that are worthwhile; give you money for imports
- US gets imported goods in exchange for green pieces of paper. Which side of the transaction gets the better deal? 
- Trade deficits are often a sign of domestic economic strength
	- Extra income -> Imports
	- Not a zero sum; foreigners taking advantage of us
## 2. Few economists think that trade deficits directly reduce GDP or jobs
$$
Y=C+I+G+(X-M)
$$
- Suppose the government gets people to stop buying foreign cars ($M$ goes down)
	- All else being equal, GDP goes up 
	- $C$ is consumption of domestically made cars and foreign made cars ($M$ goes down, so $C$, $I$, and $G$ may also go down)
	- $Y$ will stay the same
## Thought experiment is it realistic to think that $Y$ would go up a lot if $(X-M)$ went up?
2023: 
- GDP was $27 trillion
- Trade deficit was $1 trillion (3% of GDP)
- If the trade deficit had been eliminated, would GDP have risen to $28 trillion?
- For the economy to produce an additional 3% (28/27 - 1) would have required more capital and labor. By Okun's law that would have required unemployment rate to fall by ~1.5% point, to around 2%
- This magnitude of increase in output is completely implausible. Could cause a huge amount of inflation or a large interest rate increase by the Fed.

## 3. Virtually no economists think bilateral trade deficits with individual countries are meaningful
- Run surpluses and deficits with different countries
- Another reason bilateral deficits are not meaningful is that they are somewhat arbitrary
	- Statistic reports imports as coming from final assembler: When an American buys an iPhone it counts as an import from China even though they include parts from other places

## 4. Politicians often argue that trade deficits are caused by low US tariffs or high foreign tariffs

## Trade Deficit Truths
- The "ideal" size of the trade balance depends on the circumstances
- Trade deficits do not affect the level of GDP or jobs
- Bilateral trade deficits are irrelevant 
- Tariffs and "unfair" trade practices do not affect trade deficits
## Context and Caveat
- **Not** saying all trade or trade agreements are good. There are many important issues, like what trade does for growth, consumer well being, employment, inequality and national security that are debatable. It is just saying that **trade deficits** are not in themselves the key issue.
- The popular arguments/concerns on trade deficits are misplaced. But there are some reasons that excessive trade deficits---or trade surpluses---can be a concern.
# Two Key International Economic Identities
## Key Definitions
**Net Exports (Trade Balance):**
$$
NX \equiv X-M
$$
**Current Account:**
$$
CA \equiv NX + NFP + NT
$$
- NFP: Net factor payments
- NT: Net transfers
**Financial ("Future") Account:**
Net capital flows = Purchase of domestic assets by foreigners - purchase of foreign assets held domestically
- UK buys US treasury bond is a positive for the US financial account (Exported Treasury bond to the UK)
**(National) Saving:** All of the income that is not consumed by households or the government
$$
S \equiv Y - C - G
$$
Saving Rate:
$$
S/Y
$$
Note: The $Y$ in this is actually $GDP + NFP + NT$ 

We can also think of saving as:
$$
S \equiv [(Y-T)-C] + [T-G]
$$
- $[(Y-T)-C]$: **Private saving**. The difference between disposable income and consumption
- $[T-G]$: **Government saving**. The difference between taxes/transfers and public spending. Note if the government runs a budget deficit this is negative.
## National saving goes up when:
- Government's budget deficit goes down (or budget surplus goes up)
- Households save a larger fraction of their income
- Businesses retain more of their earnings without paying out or reinvesting them
## Identity 1: Saving-Investment Identity
$$
\begin{align}
Y &\equiv C + I + G + (X-M) \\
(Y - C - G) - I &= (X-M) \\
S - I &\equiv NX \equiv CA
\end{align}
$$
- Recall that NX is closely related to CA. The definition of saving is slightly different in each identity to make both of these identities hold

## Identity 2: Balance of Payments (BOP) Identity
$$
CA + FA \equiv 0
$$
- Often the FA has the opposite sign convention, including in both official US and IMF data, in which case the identity is $CA = FA$. 
- BOP identity also includes a small/zero item called the Capital Account which we ignore
- Confusingly, what we now call the FA used to be called the capital account, so sometimes referred that way
![[Pasted image 20240331170912.png]]
## Why BOP Identity Works: Double-entry bookkeeping
Every transaction resulting in a sale of a good or service to a foreigner is recorded as a credit (or positive) on the CA. Those same funds received from the sale need to be used to purchase an asset or reduce a liability, which is recorded as a debit (or negative) on the FA.

![[Pasted image 20240331171240.png]]
## Combining the two identities
$$
S - I = \text{Net purchase of foreign assets}
$$
- If a country saves more than it invests (in equipment, houses, etc.) then the remainder will be used to net purchase foreign assets (i.e., an import of foreign assets or a negative FA)
- If a country invests more than it saves then it will be the opposite; it will have to export domestic assets, or a net purchase of domestic assets, a positive on the FA
## Three perspectives on trade surpluses (and vice versa for trade deficits)
- **Exports are more than imports.** E.g., Germany is very good at making exported machinery and parts.
- **Saving is more than investment.** E.g., Germany saves a lot (including running budget surpluses) and does not have very high levels of investment.
- **It buys more foreign assets than vice versa (i.e, they buy bonds and stocks).** E.g., Germany invests a lot in factories in Eastern Europe and stocks and bonds in the US
## Note: Identity sheds light on some of the trade myths
- The flips side of a trade deficit is a FA surplus. Effectively international exchange---including the CA and FA---are always balanced. Is exporting green pieces of paper good?
- Tariffs generally do not change $S - I$. So they do not change the trade balance.
# Current Account Imbalances (Complicated)
## Problematic Overall Trade Deficit (CA Deficit): Case of Argentina
![[Pasted image 20240331183817.png]]
- Argentina wasn't putting money to good use -> Getting more and more debt -> Sudden stop (People stop giving money -> Shift surplus rather than deficit)
![[Pasted image 20240331184853.png]]
- Oil; borrow from rest of world to get stuff to drill
- Sell to get CA surplus

![[Pasted image 20240331190218.png]]
- Lucky that people lend to the US for low rates of return (Bonds; safe and liquid -> Get away with lower interest rate)
- US world reserve currency
- Net foreign debtor

## Why large overall trade or CA deficits can be worrisome
- **A sign of bad domestic polices that reduce future incomes.** Represents borrowing from abroad that needs to be repaid. So a country can consume more today but could be poorer in the future. (Technically, lower future GNP.)
	- Saving that is too low because the government is dissaving too much (i.e., running a budget deficit) or polices do not encourage private saving
	- Investment that is too high because a bubble directs excessive funds into unproductive uses, like too much housing
- **Risk of a sudden stop.** A current account deficit requires annual borrowing or other capital inflows. In addition, much of borrowing may need to be rolled over. If foreigners are unwilling to make net purchases (or rollovers) of a country's assets that can lead to a dramatic change and/or a crisis
	- The risk of this depends on:
		- Magnitude of the CA deficit
		- Composition of the CA deficit (e.g., short-term debt is more risky than FDI)
		- The gross balances. (Even with no CA deficit if lots of money is flowing both directions there is rollover risk.)
- **Negative international spillovers.**
## Why large overall trade or CA surpluses can also be worrisome
- **A sign of bad domestic policies that reduce present consumption or future incomes.**
	- Saving that is too high because it is forced by the government indirectly (e.g., state-owned enterprises in China pay limited dividends or inadequate social insurance leads to excessive precautionary saving) or directly (e.g., excessive government budget surpluses)
	- Investment that is too low because policies discourage it
- **Potnential for negative spillovers to other countries.)
	- Investment that is too low because policies discourage itt

## How could the US reduce its trade deficit if it wanted to?
**Increase saving:**
- Encourage more private saving, for example through more automatic enrollment in 401(k)'s
- More saving by government, that is run a smaller budget deficit
**Reduce investment**:
- Discourage companies from investing in equipment, structures, and intellectual property (Likely a bad idea)
