# Intro
Regions have diverged over a long period of time:

- Used to be very close, but now very different
# More recently there has been convergence on average

Economic growth has dramatically reduced extreme poverty:

# Geography
Used to be leading explanation

Incidence of malaria is negatively correlated with per capita incomes
![[Pasted image 20240503204356.png]]

Different countries have very different access to oceans and navigable river

## Limitations of geographic explanations for per capita GDP differentials
- **Impact of geography is not invariant/exogenous but also depends on technology**
	- Air conditioning expanded production in US south
	- Italy used to have malaria, now doesn't
- **Large variations by geography.** E.g., Mexico has a more favorable geography than Australia
- **Large variations over time for the same geography: "Reversal of Fortune."** In 1500, areas now occupied by India, Mexico, and Peru were much richer than areas now occupied by US, Canada, and Australia. Has since reversed.

# Culture
- Racist views about the Korean and Japanese people in the 1900s: Poor countries were poor because of their culture, rich countries rich for same reason. Japanese and Koreans categorized as lazy (Gullick 1903, Webb 1912). Germans indolent.
- A lot of these are **consequences of poverty.** Example: Culture of lateness. Time important when manufacturing; must show up for shift on time. Agrarian, doesn't matter as much what time 
These cultural predictions were proven badly wrong:

Modern research on deep historical origins of culture
## Slavery and mistrust in Africa
- Trust important needed for complicated division of labor (critical in order to have a rich country)
- Ethnic groups in Africa, some affected heavily by slavery, some weren't. Opinion surveys about mistrust -> Correlation
- Culture, or institutions? Raid -> Destruction of local institutions, rule of law, good governments -> Lack of trust rather than observation by people
- Look at those that do not live in Africa but were affected by slavery -> Where you lived hundreds of years ago mattered much more than where you live today. Transmitted more through culture.
## Hapsburgs and trust in Europe
- Used to be Hapsburg -> More trust, not -> Less even with same institution, etc.
## Limitations on cultural perspective
- Often ex post rationalizations, sometimes racist ones
- Limited ability to explain changes in growth rates
- Incomplete---culture is mediated through institutions
# Institutions
**Institutions**:
- Determined by individuals as members of society
- Place constraints on behavior
- Shape behavior by determining incentives
Examples:
- Liberal democracy
- Private property rights (including intellectual property)
## Technology is especially sensitive to institutions
- **Incentives to undertake risky innovation?** Innovation requires large and risky upfront investments in R&D, are businesses sure they can monetize their investments?
-   **Creative destruction?** Are new businesses allowed to enter, innovate, and challenge incumbents?
## How to not have growth: extractive institutions designed to protect small minorities
**Extractive Economic Institutions:**
- Pursue economic policies beneficial to powerful minorities
- Protect incumbents and resist creative destruction
Examples:
- China destroyed massive trade fleet in 15th century because it was threatening political elite by enriching merchants
- 1589, Queen Elizabeth I banned the newly invented knitting machine because she was afraid it would hurt knitting guilds
- Plantation economies in the Caribbean had little interest in developing new technologies---just in continuing to repress enslaved people and other workers
## More inclusive economic institutions have been essential for economic growth
**Inclusive economic institutions:**
- Place constraints on rulers/politicians 
- Give voice to new economic interests
- Enforce property rights, contracts, rule of law, competition
- Emerged in Western Europe and led to the first sustained growth

## Colonial origins of institutions: Higher settler mortality led to more extractive institutions
![[Pasted image 20240503213813.png]]
- Send as few people as possible if deadly, have weapons to kill people, and extract resources 
## Reversal of Fortune: Rich countries were targets for extraction, poor colonies were not
![[Pasted image 20240503213854.png]]
- Inclusive economies for settlers
## China's dramatic transformation
![[Pasted image 20240503214036.png]]
## Institutional changes underlying rise of China
Reforms started by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, accelerated in 1992 and continued on and off thereafter, including:
- Allowing farmers to plant the crops they want and keep the profits
- Allowing private businesses to form and grow
- Reducing (but not eliminating) limits on moving from the countryside to cities
- Setting up "special economic zones" with market rules
- Extensive integration into global economy through exports and imports
Note: 1) China still has extensive state ownership of companies and state direction of credit and subsidies. The reforms have sometimes moved forward and sometimes backwards. 2) A relatively uncommon example of a big increase in inclusive economic institutions without more inclusive political institutions
## Some questions about institutional explanations
- Where do the institutions come from and are they truly exogenous?
- Do institutional explanations fail to recognize large differences in policy between countries with similar institutions?
- How to explain countries that have periods of slow growth followed by rapid growth or vice versa with little institutional change?
- Is it too broad to answer specific questions we care about?
# Policy
## India
India embarked on dramatic reforms in the wake of a major economic crisis in 1991

Economic reforms can make a big difference in growth rates: case of India
![[Pasted image 20240503215121.png]]

Some of what India did:
- Eliminated license requirements for 80% of industries
- Eliminated requirement that large companies get prior permission before expanding or diversifying
- Shifted from a "positive list" of items allowed for import to a "negative list" where everything was allowed unless explicitly listed. Allowed free imports of almost all intermediate and capital goods.
- Cut the budget deficit by 2% of GDP and made the central bank more independent with a monetary policy committee
- Shifted to more market-determined interest rates and exchange rates
## Five policy areas critical to growth
These can make an especially big difference in underperforming low- and middle-income economies
- **Institutions:** Markets with sensible regulation, property rights, enabling disruptive innovation, trust
- **Openness:** To ideas, to people, to trade, and to technology transfer (eg., foreign direct investment)
- **Physical capital:** Especially at an earlier stage of development large-scale accumulation of physical capital, driven by high saving rates. Also, public infrastructure (And R&D, especially in higher-income countries)
- **Human capital and inclusion:** Broad-based education for all groups/genders, from early education through college (which level of education to prioritize depends on a country's income level)---and allowing all to express their full potential
- **Get macro policies right:** Avoid excessive debt, avoid economic crises and high inflation (including central bank independence) and respond effectively to recessions
## Policy differences play a big role--especially in low/middle-income economies

## Sampling of policies and growth estimates for the US
![[Pasted image 20240503220122.png]]
## Ultimately people care about objectives beyond pure growth---all of which are normative issues
- Objectives might include: poverty reduction, raising median incomes, reducing inequality, climate change mitigation, increasing national sovereignty, increasing/reducing immigration, national security, etc. These are all normative and depend on your values
- IF a policy advances growth and other objectives simultaneously should always support it
	- Generally large growth policies, especially in lower-income countries, are likely to advance multiple objectives simultaneously
- IF a policy creates a tradeoff between growth and other objectives need to evaluate with cost-benefit considerations
	- This can occur more in advanced economies where policies generally have a very small effect on growth
## Returning to the increase in convergence in recent years
![[Pasted image 20240503220437.png]]
- Convergence is a powerful latent force
- It works with countries with similar institutions and reasonable policies---like the OECD or US states
- The convergence at the global scale in recent decades---after 500 years of divergence---may indicate that better institutions and policies are spreading
# Summary of the explanations of growth
Growth can be explained by the following---all of which can be interrelated:
- Geography (e.g., coasts, rivers, diseases)
- Culture (e.g., work ethic, saving ethic)
- Institutions (e.g., participatory democracy)
- Policies (e.g., tax or education system)
- Convergence
