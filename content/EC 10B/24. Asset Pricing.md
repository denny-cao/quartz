# Standard Asset Pricing: Fundamentals
- "Fundamentals": Discounted value of future payments to investors
- Bey stuff that is undervalued relative to fundamentals
- Sell stuff that is overvalued
## Fundamentals (Expected Net Present Value)
$$
M_0 = \mathbb{E}_0\left[\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\frac{D_t+B_t}{(1+i)^t}\right]
$$
- $M_0$: Total market capitalization (now)
- $D_t$: Dividend at horizon $t$
- $B_t$: Buyback at horizon $t$
- $i$: Interest rate for Net Present Value
- $\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}x_t$: Sum of $x_t$ over all horizons
$$
\text{share price} = \frac{M_0}{\text{\# of shares}}
$$
If stock price exceeds fundamental value, **short**
- Borrow a share from a share owner
- Sell the borrowed share at stock price, pocketing proceeds
- Wait for stock to return to fundamental value
- Repurchase share at fundamental value and return repurchased share to person from whom you borrowed as hare in first place (doesn't need to be same share, just same share class)
- Profit: Stock price - Fundamental Value - Borrowing Fees - Opportunity cost of collateral
## Good estimate of fundamental value
- **Market price of a stock** is usually a very good estimate of its fundamental value
- Buying and selling by "smart money" pushes the market price toward its fundamental value
- If fundamentals are already fully **priced in**, there is nothing you can do to outperform the market by "trading"
- You might as well buy-and-hold a low-cost stock market index fund
# Non-standard Asset Pricing: Bubbles
What else could motivate trading other than fundamentals?
## Sentiment
"Sentiment" or "animal spirits". Buy it because people have belief it has value even though no intrinsic value.

South Sea Bubble
- Excitement of sharing holds for company
## Pump and Dump
Buy because has no value, and rip other people off
## Bubble-based (speculative) trading
Buy if you think the price will go up
- After buying, hold if you think it will keep rising
- After buying, sell if you think it is only up temporarily
Fundamentals need not to be part of the analysis
## Speculative asset markets
- Crypto
- NFTs
- Meme stocks
- r/WallStreetBets and other retail trader sites
- Commodities speculation (Silver in 2021)
- Explosive "penny stock" trading
- IPO first-day pops
- SPAC's, Celebrity SPACs
- Historical bubbles: South Sea, roaring 20's, tech bubble 90s, housing prices 2000s
