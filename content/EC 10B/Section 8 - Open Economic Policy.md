# Overview and Review
Goal for Unit 4: Understanding linkages between world economies
- Trade and trade deficits
	- $CA \equiv S - I$ (Saving-Investment Identity)
		- CA deficits can be due to low saving or high investment
	- $CA + FA \equiv 0$ (Balance of Payments Identity)
		- CA deficit = FA surplus, exporting assets to the rest of world 
	- $CA \approx NX$ ($CA = NX + NFP +NT$, and the other two terms are small compared to $NX$)
- **Uncovered Interest Parity**: Model of exchange rates based on equilibrium in financial markets 
- Departures from UIP
	- Countries can keep their exchange rates off UIP curve using capital controls or international reserves
	- But with potential risks for currency arises
- Importance of coordination between countries, international organizations like the IMF
## Open Economy Macro Policy
$$
Y \equiv C(Y-T,r) + I(Y,r) + G + (X-M)
$$
- Units 2 and 3: Ignored $NX$
- What determines demand for $NX$?
	- In open economy: Changes to $NX$ can amplify or dampen the effect of monetary and fiscal policy
	- Exchange rates play an important role
- **Most of the closed economy intuition is basically true but it changes a little---and depends on whether exchange rates are fixed or floating.**
- # Determinants of Net Exports
## Factors that increase net exports (and reverse decreases)
**Exchange rate depreciation increases net exports**:
- **Exports up**: Makes it cheaper to buy home country goods so foreigners will buy more of them
- **Imports down**: More expensive to buy foreign goods, so buy less (volume effect). (You also pay more for the foreign goods your country imports, the value effect, but we assume the volume effect is larger than the value effect.)
**GDP affects net exports**:
- **Exports up**: When GDP increases in foreign countries
- **Imports down**: When GDP declines domestically
## CAVEAT: Exchange rate depreciations may be contractionary in emerging markets
**Exchange rate depreciation makes it harder to repay foreign debt.** If an EM sees its exchange rate depreciate then it will have a harder time paying dollar-denominated debt

**Can force government to cut spending or raise taxes to make payments on its bonds.** (Reducing G and/or C)

**Can hurt banks, leading them to cut back lending.** (Reducing I and/or C)

**Not part of our open economy macro policy model, but an important consideration to keep in mind**
## Net Export Equation
$$
NX = f(e,Y,Y^\text{foreign})
$$
- If $e$ goes up (i.e., the domestic currency appreciates) then it becomes cheaper to buy foreign goods and is more costly for foreigner consumers to buy domestic goods, so $NX \downarrow$ (Inversely related)
	- This is the **dominant effect** 
- If $Y \uparrow$ domestic consumers purchase more imports so $NX \downarrow$ (Inversely related)
- If $Y^f \uparrow$ foreign consumers purchase more exports so $NX\uparrow$ (Directly related)

## Multiplier is smaller in an open economy because of import leakage

## Importance of open economy effects depends on how  the open economy is

# Monetary Policy w/Floating Exchange Rates
## Monetary policy has an additional impact that amplifies its effect w/floating interest rates
$$
i \downarrow \implies e\downarrow
$$
- UIP Relationship
$$
e \downarrow \implies NX \uparrow
$$
- Exports cheaper, imports more expensive
**This provides an even bigger boost to output than just the domestic channel of interest rates**
## Expansionary monetary policy in the foreign exchange market

# Exchange Rate Policy
## A country w/fixed exchange rates (and no capital controls) cannot use monetary policy
$$
(i - i^f)\uparrow \implies e \uparrow
$$
- Central bank cannot pick whatever $i$ it **wants** based on macroeconomic considerations
- Instead, will have to pick whatever $i$ is **needed** to keep $e$ at its chosen fixed rate
- Often this will mean that when $i^f \uparrow$ then the central bank will need to raise $i$

## Alternative policy tool for a country with fixed exchange rates
**Devaluation**: When a country with a fixed exchange rate depreciates its exchange rate (Note: $e \downarrow \implies i \downarrow$)
**Revaluation**: When a country with a fixed exchange rate appreciates its exchange rates. (Note: $e \uparrow \implies i \uparrow$)
## Devaluation lowers IR
![[Pasted image 20240404141642.png]]
## In theory a devaluation is identical to a reduction in IR
![[Pasted image 20240404141952.png]]
## For example, when UK was forced off its fixed exchange rate in 1992
![[Pasted image 20240404142523.png]]
## In practice, exchange rate policy has limits
- Often is forced on countries rather than a choice
- Only works with an unexpected, credible, one-time exchange rate change. This is hard in practice
- May undo the benefits of fixed exchange rates---which is a credible nominal anchor and predictability for trade
- Devaluation makes it harder for a country to repay its dollar-denominated debt. May make it harder to borrow
# Fiscal Policy
## Reminder of discretionary fiscal policy
**Direct effect**: Expansion increases $Y$
**Indirect effects**:
- Traditional Keynesian multiplier: Augments the effect, the magnitude depends on the exact policy
- **Crowding out**: *Can* dampen the effect but depends on how the central bank responds
	- Keep IR from rising (No crowd out)
	- Allow IR to rise naturally (Partial crowd out)
	- Deliberately raise IR even more to fully offset the fiscal expansion (Full crowd out)
## Floating exchange rate: Government increases borrowing to finance deficits
![[Pasted image 20240404143107.png]]
## Floating exchange rate: Higher IR translates into exchange rate appreciation
![[Pasted image 20240404143123.png]]
## Floating exchange rate: Expansionary fiscal policy and aggregate demand
![[Pasted image 20240404143141.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240404143146.png]]
## Fixed exchange rate: IR cannot be allowed to move
![[Pasted image 20240404143222.png]]
## Fixed exchange rate: Fiscal expansion automatically leads to a monetary expansion

## Fixed exchange rate: Expansionary fiscal policy and aggregate demand
