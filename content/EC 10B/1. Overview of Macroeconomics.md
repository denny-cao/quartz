We have two big questions:
# 1. Why do recessions happen? What can policy do to reduce economic distress?
![[Pasted image 20240122105740.png]]
- 2008 recession: 10% unemployment rate with 15 million unemployed workers
- 2020 recession (COVID): 14.8% unemployment rate with 23 million unemployed workers
- Great Depression of the 1930s

# 2. What causes income (GDP) per capita to vary across countries and across time?

![[Pasted image 20240122105813.png]]
- **Economic growth has reduced the percentage of the world's population living on less than $2.15/day** (extreme poverty).
	- 1820: 90%, today: 10%

- Per capita GDP and poverty: Decrease poverty with higher GDP
# Other Questions
- **Will robots take our jobs**?
- **Why do we need financial regulation**?
	- FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried bankruptcy. How can regulations be designed to avoid traumas like this?
- **How does monetary policy work**?
	- Federal Reserve System
- **Will rising debt cause a crisis**?
- **Is the trillion-dollar US trade deficit a problem? What about the $400 billion trade deficit with China?**
- **How should you make decisions?**
# What is Macroeconomics?
**Macroeconomics**: Study of economy as a whole
- Rather than looking at each individual good, we average the cost of all goods 
- Note: We cover a few topics that are considered microeconomics in EC10b, like consumer finances
## What is the role of microeconomics in macroeconomics?
- Agents optimize, and their mutual optimization results in equilibrium for the economy as a whole. Some of the optimization we see:
	- People decide how much to work and businesses decide how many people to hire
	- Businesses decide how many factories to build
	- Consumers decide how much to spend and save
	- Investors decide what assets to buy and sell
- In many cases, we ground the macroeconomic analysis in this microeconomic analysis "microfounded". But sometimes we just focus on aggregate relationships.
# Limits of macroecnomics
- **Hard to have clear empirical evidence**:
	- Cannot run randomized control trials or do natural experiments in most cases
	- Cannot easily do empirical analysis when causation runs in all directions (variables are "endogenous")
	- The economy is constantly evolving so causal relationships are changing (ex. pandemic economics)
- **Hard to predict**: Both because of the above and also because of random shocks
- **More "schools" of thought in macro than micro**: Ex. economists disagree about whether the recovery from recession should be largely left to markets or led forcefully by government policy
# What macroeconomics can and cannot do
**Cannot**:
- **Make precise predictions**. People predicting GDP in next quarter or next recession are not doing what most academic or policy macroeconomics do
**Can**:
- **Help diagnose the correct issues**. Ex. sometimes economic growth requires more consumer spending and other times it requires more saving
- **Help prevent problems**. Ex. Better financial regulation can reduce risks, but generally cannot eliminate them
- **Help deal with problems after they occur**. In January 2020 virtually no economist predicted a pandemic-induced recession, but that does not mean they do not have tools to help treat one after it happens.
# What someone who completes EC10b will be able to do
- Critically read articles about macroeconomy 
- Participate in some of the major policy debates ex. how worried about budget deficit, understanding how trade w/China both helps and hurts US households
- Better understand financial markets including for your own (eventual) financial planning
- Do some numerical analysis on a spreadsheet, including understanding key macroeconomic data and data analysis
- Build on this knowledge through further courses, concentrating in economics, or just keeping up with issues on your own
# Growth v. Fluctuations
![[Pasted image 20240122112639.png]]
- **In the long run, differences in average growth swamp the effects of transitory fluctuations** 
![[Pasted image 20240122112736.png]]
- **"In the long run we are all dead" and recessions cause disparate pain in the short run**
**Diagnosing macroeconomic problems: at potential or below potential?**
- If at potential, need more growth (more factories, workers, or technology)
- If below potential, need to fight recession (unemployed workers back in unused factories); use what we already have to fight recession
**Different policies for different circumstances**
- **Growth policies** when operating at potential: Regulatory and tax reform, education and public investment, trade policy
- **Fluctuation policies** when operating below potential: Monetary policy, fiscal policy, exchange rate policy
