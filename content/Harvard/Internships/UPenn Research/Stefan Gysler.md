## Mentor Areas

Radiology, Artificial Intelligence, Radiomics, Gynecology, Gynecologic Oncology, Surgery. 

## Description:

We are seeking undergraduates who wish to learn more about radiology, artificial intelligence, surgery and/or gynecology oncology to assist with a novel research project combining artificial intelligence with clinical medicine. Research assistants will help to review CT scan images and segment images to train an AI algorithm to predict success of ovarian cancer surgery. Researchers will also have an opportunity to observe ovarian cancer surgery and work with Gynecologic Oncologists and Radiologists to improve their ability to read actual patient CT scans. We anticipate participation in the project to last one year with a commitment of 2-3 hours per week on your own schedule. Participants will be included on all publications originating from this work, including abstract presentations and peer-reviewed publications. 

## Preferred Qualifications

Researchers will need access to a PC computer. Otherwise, no specific qualifications are required.
