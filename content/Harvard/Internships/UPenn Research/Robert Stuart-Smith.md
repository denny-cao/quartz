## Mentor Areas

Robotic Fabrication, Behaviour-based robotic programming, Multi-agent systems, Additive Manufacturing, Generative design computation, Building design

## Description:

Projects in progress aim to reduce the environmental and economic cost of building whilst expanding qualitative and creative possibilities through the use of design computation and robotic fabrication:

1)Robotically fabricated prototype concrete house: A full-scale house prototype is being developed using state of the art robot fabrication techniques (robot hot-wire cut formwork) to manufacture complex formed cavity concrete. The house will be designed for disassembly (DFD), relocation and re-use.

2) Industrial Robot Additive Manufacturing. Using industrial robot extrusion (clay, plastic, concrete) to develop building construction methods. Research into behaviour-based programming, material composition and extrusion hardware.

3) Autonomous manufacturing. Research into adaptive modes of real-time manufacture using computer vision, machine learning and multi-agent programming.

## Preferred Qualifications

Computer Programming, mechanical or electrical engineering experience preferred.
