## Mentor Areas

Lynn Wu's research examines how emerging information technologies, such as artificial intelligence and analytics, affect innovation, business strategy, and productivity. Specifically, her work follows three streams. In the first stream, she examines how data analytics and artificial intelligence affect firm innovation, business strategy, labor demand, and productivity for both large firms and startups. In her second stream, she studies how enterprise social media and online platforms affect work performance, career trajectories, entrepreneurship success, and the formation of new type of biases that arise from using technologies. In her third stream of research, Lynn leverages fine-grained nanodata available through online digital traces to predict economic indicators such as real estate trends, labor trends and product adoption.

## Description:

This project consists of examining how AI, robotics, machine learning and data analytics are transforming innovation, jobs, organizations and productivity. We specifically would like to examine how the newest technologies are transforming the innovation process at firms and how that in turn affects employment and skills. The student will be responsible for culling through a large amount of data and applying machine learning techniques and statistical tools when necessary to uncover underlying patterns.

## Preferred Qualifications

Web scraping skills and the ability to process unstructured text is required. Students should have relevant skills in Python or Java. Machine learning experience is preferred but not required. However, students must be open to learn the necessary machine learning algorithms and statistical methods when necessary.
