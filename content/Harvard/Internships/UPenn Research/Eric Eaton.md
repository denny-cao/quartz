## Lifelong Machine Learning
### Summary
Lifelong learning is essential for an intelligent agent that will persist in the real world with any amount of versatility. Animals learn to solve increasingly complex tasks by continually building upon and refining their knowledge. Virtually every aspect of higher-level learning and memory involves this process of continual learning and transfer.  In contrast, most current machine learning methods take a "single-shot" approach in which knowledge is not retained between learning problems.  

My research seeks to develop lifelong machine learning for intelligent agents situated for extended periods in an environment and faced with multiple tasks.  The agent will continually learn to solve multiple (possibly interleaved) tasks through a combination of knowledge transfer from previously learned models, revision of stored source knowledge from new experience, and optional guidance from external teachers or human experts.  The goal of this work is to enable persistent agents to develop increasingly complex abilities over time by continually and synergistically building upon their knowledge.   Lifelong learning could substantially improve the versatility of learning systems by enabling them to quickly learn a broad range of complex tasks and adapt to changing circumstances.
