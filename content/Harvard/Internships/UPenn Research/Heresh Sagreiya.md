# Mentor Areas

This work would focus on applying machine learning/deep learning techniques to medical imaging for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and cancer treatment monitoring. There are a number of large datasets available both at Penn (i.e. Penn Biobank) as well as externally (NIH, UK Biobank) that would be amenable to this analysis. My goal for students is to present their work at national/international meetings and participate in peer-reviewed publications.

# Description:

I am willing to work with students to identify any potential area of interest related to medical imaging, including radiology and pathology images. I am currently working on projects that involve applying machine learning techniques to early cancer diagnosis, fatty liver disease, and hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.

# Preferred Qualifications

Computer programming skills (Python, TensorFlow, Keras) are a plus, but not strictly required.
