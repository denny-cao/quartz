## Mentor Areas

Dr. Bernardis's research focuses on computer vision applied to microscopic image analysis and computational dermatology. In particular, her areas of expertise include image segmentation, contour grouping, shape representation, and texture analysis.

## Description:

Creating and deploying automated computational imaging tools for the dermatology clinic. We have various projects available that can be tailored to specific interest and background. Some examples include: computer vision research to extract features of clinical interest,  computer graphics  modeling to create synthetic datasets for training neural networks,  statistical studies to correlate dermatology diseases with other conditions, testing and improving new interfaces for teledermatology.

No clinical background necessary, although an interest in dermatology is needed. Computer science background & programming skills are a plus (see below for further details) but also not required.

## Preferred Qualifications

Any of the following computer science background & programming skills is a plus: computer vision, pattern recognition, computer graphics, medical image analysis, and/or machine learning; proficiency in computer programming (e.g., Matlab, Python, R).
