## Mentor Areas

Dr. Bassett's research area is quantum systems, specifically understanding and controlling the nanoscale quantum properties of charge, spin, and light in different materials towards the development of future quantum technologies. Potential applications of these systems include: use in quantum computers, design of secure communication networks, probing new materials, and the development of new optical sensors for measuring nanoscale dynamics in biological systems.

## Description:

We regularly have opportunities for undergraduates to work on a variety of research projects. Some examples include: designing and building optical measurement apparatus, developing numerical simulations, characterizing new materials, fabricating nanoscale devices in the Singh center, and generally contributing to research projects in the quantum engineering group.

## Preferred Qualifications

Our lab is interdisciplinary; we work on projects spanning physics, photonics, electrical engineering, chemistry, and biology. Students majoring in any science or engineering field with an interest in quantum science are welcome to apply. Completion of the freshman-level physics curriculum (150/151) is helpful but not strictly necessary. Some familiarity with scientific computing (particularly MATLAB and Python) is desirable. Responsibilities vary by project, but a commitment to trying new things and working with a research team are necessary.
