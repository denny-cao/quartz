## Mentor Areas

My interests in the nature of information, and the ways it is produced, processed and transmitted have led to my present research in neuroscience. My ongoing work shows how numerous structural and functional aspects of the organization of sensory and cognitive systems can be understood as adaptations to efficiently compute and process information subject to the constraints inherent in biological computation.

## Description:

Conduct research on the principles of computation and information transmission by neural circuits in the brain.  The focus will be either be on sensory systems (vision, audition or olfaction) or cognitive systems (spatial navigation, memory, or decision making).  Students will conduct research on projects in the group in collaboration with graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.

*Happy to mentor students remotely.* 

## Preferred Qualifications

Strong mathematical skills and knowledge of computer programming are required.  Prior knowledge of linear algebra and differential equations is important.   Knowledge of the MATLAB or Mathematica programming environments is helpful, but not required.
