## Mentor Areas

Our research centers on planning, control, modeling, machine learning, and formal analysis of robots as they interact with the world. Whether a robot is assisting within the home, or operating in a manufacturing plant, the fundamental promise of robotics requires touching and affecting a complex environment in a safe and controlled fashion. We are focused on developing computationally tractable algorithms which enable robots to operate both dynamically and safely as they quickly maneuver through and interact with their environments. Right now, we are particularly interested in understanding the interplay between the non-smooth dynamics of contact and algorithmic methods like machine learning and numerical optimization.
