**What skills and experience do you possess to be successful in a role at Goldman Sachs?** 
Not being afraid to ask for help. 

During my GRASP Lab internship, I initially kept questions to myself in sticky notes, afraid of not understanding. I remember trying to debug an xacro file for an hour. When I swallowed my pride and asked for help, my mentor, Leon, immediately found the error: I wrote <xacro: macro> instead of <xacro:macro>—I added a space!

Leon told me something many businesses follow: fail fast, fail often. I learned to embrace my mistakes—to use mistakes as opportunities to grow.

During TGIF dinners, Adam and Alp shared problems they faced getting the robot to roll a ball in a circle. Junyao marveled about Google's Parti model. I began to ask questions whenever I was confused.

I set up a meeting with Professor Dinesh Jayaraman to learn more about our work. I learned about the perception-action loop of learning, Held and Hein’s kitten carousel experiment, the ethical implications of robotics. At home, I tried to understand David Silver’s reinforcement learning lectures and asked my lab mates any questions I had.

I’ve become more excited about learning knowing that its normal to be confused—knowing that I no longer need to keep my questions as sticky notes.

**Describe how you have overcome a personal or professional challenge. How has this prepared you for the Goldman Sachs Emerging Leaders Series program?**
For my MITES Semester (formerly MOSTEC) project, my goal was to create a robot dog that would follow GPS coordinates provided by some map service to get to a destination given by the user through an Android app.

I was extremely eager to get started and rushed my CAD, overlooking many design choices that would later make the project harder, having to spend a lot of time fixing things I didn’t anticipate. When the body of the robot dog was finished 3D printing and I began to assemble it, I had to improvise and drill holes to fit motors and cutting sections out to even fit the Arduino parts. 

This experience taught me the importance of thorough planning and adaptability when issues do arise. I began taking more time to CAD during robotics club, as well as incorporating git into my workflow to make it easier to troubleshoot and revert to previous designs if necessary. Participating in this program, I am eager to learn from some of the most brilliant minds in the world in how they problem solve and how I can continue to apply the lessons of my past failures to improve myself both professionally and personally.
