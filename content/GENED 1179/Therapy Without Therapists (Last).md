"Despite increased demand for mental health services, those who seek treatment [can’t get it](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/11/khon1104abstract/en/?ref=damagemag.com). Most people seeking care overwhelmingly prefer [psychotherapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4156137/?ref=damagemag.com) over medication, yet they are more likely to be prescribed an [antidepressant](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10040570?ref=damagemag.com), often from their [primary care provider](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/194548?ref=damagemag.com)."

"Therapy is [expensive](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/therapy-expensive-insurance_n_5900048ee4b0af6d718992e7?ref=damagemag.com). Private insurance companies don’t want to pay for unprofitable, long-term services provided by highly skilled (i.e., high-priced) professionals. When insurance companies do reimburse therapists for their services, they do not [pay a living wage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/paradigm-shift/201905/cant-find-psychologist-who-accepts-insurance-heres-why?ref=damagemag.com). Nor can therapists afford the prohibitive barriers to managing insurance claims—[therapists report](https://www.apa.org/workforce/publications/15-health-service-providers/report.pdf?ref=damagemag.com) that most of their patients pay out-of-pocket for therapy or receive minimal insurance coverage for mental health services. When healthcare is privatized, socially useful services are scarce or nonexistent."

"The solution is equally obvious. Healthcare should be a universally-available public good."

"problem is not that a market-driven healthcare system unequally distributes much-needed care. Rather, the problem for them is that the provision of mental health services is not entirely subsumed by capital’s law of motion. Mental healthcare, by their logic, ought to be further scientifically managed to cut costs and increase efficiency."

"Whether referred to as the division of labor or task-shifting, the effect of this atomization is the same: it cheapens labor power. As Harry Braverman describes in Labor and Monopoly Capital: “Translated into market terms, this means that the labor power capable of performing the process may be purchased more cheaply as dissociated elements than as a capacity integrated in a single worker.”"

"The proliferation of non-physician medical roles [decreases total compensation for healthcare workers](https://journals.lww.com/jaapa/fulltext/2016/07000/physician_assistant_specialty_choice_.8.aspx?casa_token=lk38dEUJFPQAAAAA%3A34kOqLzzySMU_u4yQ4hLsF2IyPCbzvQ36adWkgp7vefWOb9G2NzxS8_cbzVfjo_U6ED7kdzBSwAUmqqnGp2bNFXe&ref=damagemag.com), but most importantly this increased fragmentation often [reduces the quality of care](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02813432.2020.1714143?ref=damagemag.com), putting patients at risk."

"Rather than demanding that treatment length be determined by patient needs in lieu of artificially capping sessions to save money, mental health researchers felt compelled to accept the constraints of a privately-rationed health system and [developed brief, sometimes single-session therapies](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1348/147608305X60523?casa_token=0g4DX4Iu8IgAAAAA%3ADIsLVvX_hhLUKpdjfcIYrjjiuzUxaOTUJHLQPYlP1VVCNT2S-SAuFlI7p0lvBLPL5M0upZU0ehoRTB89&ref=damagemag.com). Many of these often well-meaning, scientists justified setting their sights lower by invoking [patients’ preferences for a quicker fix](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0085653&ref=damagemag.com) than psychoanalysis."

"In the past several decades, despite growing treatment demand, the mean number of psychotherapy visits has [declined](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10040570?ref=damagemag.com), in large part because insurance companies are unwilling to reimburse for longer term therapy services."

"In terms of its effect on workers, manualizing therapy has the effect of reducing therapists’ control over their work, rendering them instruments in a process rather than co-creators of it with their patients. [New data](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-36553-001?CASA_ERROR=CASA_TOKEN_INVALID&ref=damagemag.com) suggest that reducing therapists’ autonomy is associated with therapist burnout, reduced engagement by patients, and worse treatment. Stripping therapists of skill and autonomy has only reduced the quality of mental healthcare, undercutting attempts by even the most well-meaning researchers to improve therapy with science."

"Another prong in the fourth industrial revolution in mental healthcare, per Dr. Simon’s warning, is the development of digital health technologies. These technological developments further the process of making therapists obsolete, or at the very least accelerate the pace at which mental health workers have become mere appendages to machines. Over the past several years [venture capital](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2770792?ref=damagemag.com) has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in direct-to-consumer digital mental health technologies that offer self-directed meditation and mindfulness exercises, text-based therapeutic strategies, and telehealth coaching offered by non-professionals."
