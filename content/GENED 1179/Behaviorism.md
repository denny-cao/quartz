# Overview
- All behaviors learned through interaction with environment
- Psychology is branch of experimental natural science
- Focus should be on observable behaviors/events, not internal states (thinking, emotions); can't see these thus can't measure them
- Human behavior similar to animal behavior and thus can be understood through experimenting on animals
- All behavior conforms to the model of stimulus-response
# Behavior Therapy Basics
- Focus on:
	- Behavior (What someone does)
	- Learning (how they came to do what they do)
	- Assessment and evaluation of what they do
- Principles
	- Abnormal behavior acquired and maintained just as is normal behavior
	- People are characterized by what they think, feel, and do in specific situations
	- Outcome evaluated in terms of behavior change and maintenance thereof
# Pavlovian Response (Stimulus-Response Theory)
Observation:
- Dogs salivate in presence of food
- Ring bell when presenting food (dog salivates when bell is rung, even without food)
**Conditioned Response**: Conditioned to respond w/o food
- This is a **learned behavior**
## Pavlovian Mythology
- Never used bell to train dogs
- Never shared behaviorists' disregard for subjective experience
- Mistreatment of dogs
- Focused on psychic secretions, drool dogs produced by means other than exposure to food
- Classical conditioning is his legacy, but as important was his commitment to the scientific method
## John B. Watson
- Father of behaviorism in the US 
- Behaviorist Manifesto
- "All that interests the behaviorist is behavior, not thoughts, feelings, ideas."
	- Can't be seen, measured; only accessible to those experiencing them therefore not valid data
# Behavioral Therapy
- Cost effective; insurers like
	- Shorter treatments
	- Evidence based
- Effective for particular disorders
	- OCD: Combination with antidepressants
	- Panic disorder: as or more effective than pharm treatment alone
	- Phobias
# Cognitive Revolution in Psychology
- At Harvard
- Wanted to bring thinking back into psychology
- 1950s: Cognitive science inclduing expeirmental psychology, linguistic, computer science, and AI, and later neuroscience
- Counter-revolution: Define psychology as the science of behavior
	- Mental events can't be observed
	- Examine behavior
	- Psychology can be a science
## Cognitive Science
- 1960: Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard
- People began to think about computers and minds, drawing connections to them
	- If we can think about internal operations of computers scientifically, why can't we for humans?
- Magic Number Seven:  lot of sevens that we can only remember seven +-2; limits for processing information
	- Limits on human capacity to process information
	- By organizing stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence of chunks, we can overcome this limitation
- People use categories and concepts as tools with which to understand the world around them (Study of Thinking)
- 1956: Miller article, Bruner book, First AI conference at Dartmouth, First version of article, "Step toward artificial intelligence" 
# Psychoanalytic Concepts
- Splitting, denial, devaluation, projection, transference
- Splitting: Divide into all good, or all bad; no greyspace. Helps us find enemies and friends
- Denial: Refsusal to accept reality when doesnt fit your views
- Omipotent Control:Want to control other people. Want to control that people act the same way we do; same thoughts we hvae in our heads. Can't control others, but can control us.
- Devaluation: If I cant have it, not worth having. Ex. Breakup. Make us feel better.
- Transference:
- Projection: Projecting your views onto someone else
- False self:
- Omnipotence: Wishes should override reality
- **Reptition and enactment**: T
- External Splitting
- Displacement
# Countertransference
The therapist sees the patient in a certain way based on the therapists own experiences.
- Deal with this through training. They go into their own therapy to identify their own patterns and the way certain things evoke certain feelings in them
- Source of information to the therapist 
	- PPT and Psychoanalytic belief that feelings are passed between the two, and the feelings that cannot be said gives a lot of information about the patient
