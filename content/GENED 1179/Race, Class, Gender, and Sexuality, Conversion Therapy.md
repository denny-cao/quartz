# Psychotherapy on Homosexuality
- Area of controversy from the start
	- Today: Not among professionals but in public discussion
	- Question: Inherited or acquired
## Freud
- Doesn't want to separate homosexuals from everyone else; they are the same
- Human beings are capable of making a homosexual object-choice and have in fact made one in their unconscious
- Petitioned on behalf of civil rights of homosexuals
- Deep curiousity; Leonardo, Michelangelo, philosophers, etc
- Homosexuals have "accomplished great things" singly and in groups
- Terms "homosocial" and "heterosocial" by J. P. Flugel arguing for superoirity of male comradership over the family and female comapny (both opposed to the work of civilization by J. P.

- "Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashmaed of, no vice, no degradation it cannot be classified as illness; variation of the sexual function, produced by a ceratin arrest of sexual develpment" (Freud)
- "What analysis can do for your son runs on a different line"; will not change him.
- On the otehrhand:
	- Fixation to woman (usually mother), leaving this, identify themselves with a woman and take themsllves as their sexual object. Their compulsive longing for men has turned out to be determeined by their ceaseless flight from women
- Arrested Development: Homosexuals only capable of loving themselves
# Sexology
- Scientific study of human sexual behavior
	- Focus on varieties and pathologies
	- Inborn/constitutional or acquired
	- Huge tomes case reports and, later, surveys of behavior
- Origins in late C19
	- Growth of capitalism: People congregate in large cities, away from ties and oversight of family and community, and take advantage of new opportunities for self-expression
	- Form themselves into homosexual communities in large (and small) cities in late C19 and early C20
	- Capitalism frees the individual
- Havelock Ellis: Sexual Inversion (1897)
	- First English language medical publication on homosexuality
	- "Invests" normal gender characteristics inverted
	- "Sexual instinct turned by inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of the same sex"
- Preserve erotica:
	- For a number of reasons, the "Inferno" is used to shelter the erotic literature. Preservation is also a paramount consideration here. According to Haynes, studies like Freud's "interpretation of Dreams" and Havelock Ellis' "Psychology of Sex" are kept locked up because "the Library was continually losing these looks"
## Sexological Principles
- Curiosity, lack of overt moralism
- Normative, but homosexuality not a disease or crime
- Interested in variation

- Alfred Kinsey:
	- Unit of measure: Outlets to orgasm, did not matter how
	- Empirical, not theoretical
	- Data: Outlets
	- Interviews: Adult white male population
	- Sexual behavior not dichotomous by arrayed on a scale
	- Kinsey Scale of Sexual Behavior: 0 is hereto, 6 is homo

		- 37% males had orgasm with another man, between adolescence and old age
		- 10% exclusively homosexual, for 3 years or more between ages 11 and 55
		- Data: No longer could homosexuality be considered pathological
			- Statistical normality could not be psychologically abnormal
		- Normalization: 1948, from Kinsey archives
	- 1972 Depathologized: Homosexuality no longer a mental disorder
	- Backlash: NARTH
		- Reparative therapy: Aims to change persons' sexual orientation from gay to straight
			- Psychotherapy, electric shock, drugs, aversive conditioning

	- Nicolosi tenets:
		- Therapists as "benevolent provacateur"
		- Father-son model
		- Homosexuals suffer from "male gender-identity deficit"
			- Intense sense of incompleteness of one's own maleness
			- We eroticize what we are not identified with
			- Mothers have been overly intimate with sons
			- Fathers have been underinvolved
			- Masculine deficit projected onto idealized males
			- Cure through "close intimate, non-sexual male friendships"
	- "Sissy Boy" Experiment
		- Little boy enrolled making feminine boy more masculine placed in experimental therapy
		- Kirk: Broken; he was different
		- Mother was concerned with playing w/girl toys
