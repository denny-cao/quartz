Article that first establishes PPT as evidence-based treatment; implicit PPT elements in other therapies

# Defining elements of PPT
- Based on psychoanalytic concepts and methods but:
	- Less frequent meetings (1-2 times per week v. 3-5)
	- May be considerably briefer
- Treatment may be either time limited or open ended
- Essence: **Exploring those aspects of self that are not fully known, especially as they are manifested and potentially influenced in the therapy relationship.**
## Focus on affect and expression of emotion
- Encourages exploration and discussion of the full range of a patient's emotions
- Describe and put words to feelings (Contradictory feelings, feelings that are troubling or threatening, and feelings that the patient may not initially be able to recognize or acknowledge)
- Intellectual insight is not the same as emotional insight
## Exploration of attempts to avoid distressing thoughts and feelings
- Defense and resistance may take forms such as: missing sessions, arriving late, being evasive, subtle forms (shifts of topic when certain ideas arise, etc.)
- Focus and explore avoidances
## Identification of recurring themes and patterns
- Recurring themes in thoughts, feelings, self-concept, relationships, and life experiences
- Patient may be aware of them but feel unable to escape (e.g a man who repeatedly finds himself drawn to romantic partners who are emotionally unavailable)
- Sometimes unaware until therapist helps them recognize and understand
## Discussion of past experience (Developmental focus)
- Past experiences (especially early experiences of attachment figures) affects our relation to, and experience of, the present
- Explore early experiences, the relation between past and present, and ways in which past tends to "live on" in present
- Focus is on how the past sheds light on current psychological difficulties
	- Free patients from bonds of past experience in order to live more fully in the present
## Focus on interpersonal relations
- Repetitive themes in a person's relationships and manner of interacting tend to emerge in some form in therapy relationship
- Goal is greater flexibility in interpersonal relationships and an enhanced capacity to meet interpersonal needs
## Exploration of fantasy life
- Encourages patients to speak freely about whatever is on their minds
- Thoughts naturally range over many areas of mental life, including desires, fears, fantasies, dreams, and daydreams
- Rich source of information about how the person views self and others, interprets and makes sense of experience, avoids aspects of experience, or interferes with a potential capacity to find greater enjoyment and meaning in life
- Goal of PPT: Include, but extend beyond, symptom remission. Should not just relieve symptoms, but also foster positive presence of psychological capacities and resources
# Effects of PPT endure, increase with time
- Benefits of PPT not only endure, but increase with time
- In contrast, benefits of other empirically supported therapies tend to decay over time for the most common disorders
- Patients with BPD:
	- Treatment benefits that equaled or exceeded those of another evidenced-based treatment DBT
	- Also showed changes in underlying psychological mechanisms believed to mediate symptom change in borderline patients
	- May account for long-term treatment benefits
# Unmarked/Unnamed PPT elements in other therapies, even in CT
# Dodo Bird verdict
- Mismatch between what PPT aims for and what is typically measured in outcome studies
- Goal of PPT: Include and extend beyond alleviation of acute symptoms
	- Psychological health not just absence of symptoms: positive presence of inner capacities and resources that allow people to live with a greater sense of freedom and possibility
	- Symptom-oriented outcome measures do not capture this
- Dodo bird verdict reflects a failure of researchers to adequately assess the range of phenomena that can change in psychotherapy

# Inner capacities and resources
# Practitioners v. researchers (Target audience of research)
- Clinical practitioners are the intended consumers of clinical research, but many psychotherapy outcome studies and meta-analyses are not for practitioners; they are densely complex and technical and often seem written primarily for other psychotherapy researchers
- Needs to become more consumer relevant
