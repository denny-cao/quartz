"magic of words"
- "Words are the essential tool of mental treatment"
Freud: Sides w/science rather than hypnotism and telepathy bc. raised on **suggestion**
- Suggestion: Say something, put an idea in your head -> Take thought as your own
- Thought they were primitive (spirits and demons behind natural phenomena)
- On the side of naturalism, but fascinated with occult phenomena
	- Thought-transference: "Inextricable from psychoanalysis"; thoughts have to get one way to another somehow
	- Telepathy
	- Sharply demarcating psychoanalysis (On the other hand, big secret that he is interested in it)

Making relationship legible to science
1. Transference
2. Therapeutic alliance

# Transference
- Freud: We don't see people for who they are... See people through patterns laid down through childhood
Origin of psychotherapy: Josef Breuer, Bertha Pappenheim
- Had Bertha talk to Josef -> Talking cure, claimed she was pregnant (hysterical pregnancy)
- Breuer told Freud... Female patient falls in love with male doctor
	- 1914: Revisits issue... transference love; love between patient and doctor
- Transference: Recognizes that there are strong, powerful forces involved in doctor-patient relationship
- **Boundaries**: Treatment "must be carried out in abstinence"
	- No sexual relationships between two parties
	- Freud: Strong emotions during therapy
- Limits to verbal modes of communication
	- Unconscious communication
	- Updated "thought transference"
	- Captures what cannot be explained about effects of relationship between therapist and patient
	- Acknowledgement of limits of words alone as medium of cure
- Treatment wouldn't be so effective if patient didn't exhibit strong feelings
Why this matters
- Patients are still seeking magical cures in therapy
	- Cast therapists as magicians
- Researchers: Associated with less sophisticated lower-class individuals
- Woebot: "Nothing magic about Woebot"
# Therapeutic Alliance
- Making relationship legible to science
- Refers to "direct human relationship between patient and analyst"
- Completely "real"
- Limitations of concept of transference
- Used to refer to the part of the patient that wants to work with therapist
