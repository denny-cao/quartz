# Model of Depression
Depressed patients experience streams of negative thoughts called **automatic thoughts**
- 3 Categories:
	- Negative ideas about themselves
	- about the world
	- about the future
**Cognitive Triad** in depression:
- Events interpreted negatively
- Depressives dislike selves
- Future assessed negatively
# Beck's Basic Principles of Cognitive Therapy
1. Mental disorders are thinking disorders
2. Thoughts influence mood
3. If patients can be taught to restructure thoughts, mood will improve
# Focus on distortions
"Experience near": Cognitive approach brings understanding and treatment of emotional disorders closer to a patient's everyday experiences
- Not helpless: We learn self-defeating ideas; we can unlearn and correct them
- Optimistic
- Self-help while other schools engender helplessness
- You can be your own scientist
