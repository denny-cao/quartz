Why is it that **"allegedly diverse methods of psychology prove to have about equal success"**?

**Proud proponent v. detached observer**
- Proud proponent: Ideology is true because achieved success in cases, and all others false
- Detached observers: "If such theoretically conflicting procedures...can lead to success, often even in similar cases, then therapeutic result is not a reliable guide to the validity of theory"

**Therapeutic result**
- Are "factors alleged to be operating in a given therapy identical with the factors that actually are operating?"
- Is it the case that "factors that actually are operating in several different therapies may not have much more in common than have the factors alleged to be operating?"
- Therapeutic result achieved cannot uncritically be used as a test of theory advanced
	- "What... accounts for the result that apparently diverse forms of psychotherapy prove successful in similar cases?"
	- "what do these therapies actually have in common that makes them equally successful?"

**Unrecognized factors**
- "There are inevitably certain **unrecognized factors** in any therapeutic situation---factors that may be even more important than those being purposely employed."
- "possible for the procedures consciously utilized by the therapist to have a largely negative value in distracting attention from certain unconscious processes by means of which the therapeutic effect is actually achieved"

**Implicit factors**

**Therapist's personality**
- "Indefinable effect on therapist's personality"
	- Unsolved problem; does it outweigh differences across methods? 

**Psychological interpretations**
- "If it is true that mental disorder represents a conflict of disintegrated personality constituents, then the unification of these constituents by some systematic ideology, regardless of what the ideology may be, would seem to be sin e qua non for a successful therapeutic result."
