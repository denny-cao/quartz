- Brand name psychotherapy... What would generic name psychotherapy look like?
# DBT v. GPM (General/Good/Good enough Psychiatric Management)
- Developed by Gunderson
- Can you distill down to common factors and focus on patients' lives outside of therapy?
- BPD Treatment
- Comparison treatment
- No differences! Even after 2 years
	- Even though one treatment more intensive, patient does not care
- Problem w/trial: Didn't get cornerstone of humanity of finding place in humanity
	- 2/3 of subjects remitted: 39% Disability, 53% Unemployment
	- Work was not emphasized in either DBT or GPM
	- Prognosis related to employment
- Depending on yourself is better than depending on therapists
# Principles of GPM
- Be active (responsive and curious) not reactive
- Support via listening, interest, selective validation
- Focus on life outside treatment (work before love)
- Professional but real relationship in treatment
- Change ie expected (but very challenging)
- Accountability since treatment depends on it
# Mechanics of GPM
- Diagnosis
	- System of knowledge that drives healthcare; with good comes bad and limitations. Can be empowering.
	- Research shows: BPD do not carry same stigma as we do
	- Start to feel sense of belonging
	- Validation and relief
	- Acceptance or interest in diagnosis
	- Find diagnosis accurate and did not experience it as a negative
	- 15 years between age of BPD onset and age of diagnosis
- Psychoeducation
	- Should teach patients about disorder so they understand
	- Symptoms: Can know when they are doing well, prevalence: consolidarity, course: you will get better, Heritability: Scientific basis 
	- Interpersonal coherence: 
		- Connected: Idealizing, dependent
		- Interpersonal stress -> Threatened: Self-injury, angry of the connected relation -> Fight or flight
		- Withdrawal by the other -> Aloneness: Paranoid, impulsive
		- Lack of holding -> Despair: Suicidal . Holding environment creates support by the other leading to connectedness again
		- Solution: Lean in to problems; support by others in difficult conversations to short-circuit path
- Accountability for change
	- Goals are essential to developing agency and self-direction
	- realistic goals are corrective to self-doubt
	- Tying people to reality, community, purpose: Grounds us
- Getting a life
	- Purpose, whatever that may be. Work, love, etc.
	- Find a way of being in the world. This is the way out of being ill-defined and vulnerable.
# Ingredients of GPM
- Mechanism
	- Goal 1: Think first
	- Goal 2: Develop a corrective relational experience (People are flawed/limited)
	- Goal 3: Get a life (Can sustain self-esteem)
- Life is the best therapy.
- "Love and work are the cornerstones of humanness." - Freud
