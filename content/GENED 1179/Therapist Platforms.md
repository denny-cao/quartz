# Talkspace
- Text more -> More money for therapist
- Sold data
- Supposed benefits: Cheaper for patient (Parking, time, etc.) as well as therapist (office)
# Critique/Assessment
- Mental health delivery: Broken
	- Lack of access
	- Profit motive
	- Therapist downward pressure on wages when more people join platform
- Apps/platforms: Untested
## Key concepts:
- Access, convienience 
- Scalability
- Illusion
- Cybetspace
- Can effective therapy occur without physical co-presence
- Sense of presence enables nervous system to recognize that one is in an environment tha tis i outsnide and not an extension fo self
## Cyberspace
- William Gibson 1984 - Neuromancer
- Reality and fantasy can be maniuplated to create many desired possibilities; where they collide
- Body in cyberspace
	- illusion of control yet
	- dependency on machines
## Chatbots
Problem w/ELIZA:
- People believed computer **understood** them
- Troubled that could **replace** therapists
## ChatGPT as therapist
- Paradox in therapy, chat will not pick it up
- Not designed to be therapist
- Has access to therapist transcripts
- Therapist takes "not knowing" stance whereas chat has outside world
- AI will/will not replace almost all therapist
- Confidentiality: Hard to get transcripts. Moments of pauses AI will not know how to deal with it... Brushed up transcripts, no actual therapy convos
# What is therapy
- Broad
	- Interpersonal persuasion
	- Health care
	- Psychosocial educaiton
	- Professionally coached change
	- Behaviorial technology
	- Form of rep-parenting
	- Purchase of friendshuip
	- Variant of shamanism
- Narrow:
	- Talk is only allowable technolgoy (Not homework, rules) only my "brand" qualifies
- Shedler: Chatbots do not teach you how to relate ot others; teaches how to engage in narcassistic world. Not worth anything unless there is some **friction** (Too easy to get therapy)

"Risk of harm"

The bond: Patients want the interpersonal relationship
"human-level bonds" as measure of success; do they feel like WoeBot can bond

Argument for WoeBot hinges on alliance
"Scalable solutions", access 
## Working Alliance Inventory
- replace therapist w/woebot
