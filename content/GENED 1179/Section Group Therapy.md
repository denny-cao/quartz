- **Libidinal ties** (Freud)
- **"Social microcosm"**: Whatever pathology outside in the world, do not need to tell problem, because they will just retell (Yalom)
- **Corrective emotional experience**
- **Process over content**
- Content: What people are actually sharing
- Process: Why people say the things they do
- Groups can be open or closed:
