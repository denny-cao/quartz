# Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PPT)
- Transference -> Therapeutic Alliance
	- Psychoanalysis developed to therapeutic alliance in PPT
- Diagnosis: More than psychoanalysis, but still less than manual methods
	- Formulation: How did diagnosis develop, how does it show up, how does it relate to them? (Diagnosis + Context)
- Chair instead of a couch
- 1-3 meetings per week (PPT) v. 3-5 meetings per week (PA)
- **Focus on feelings**
- Focus on here and now rather than past (Still think about the past; how past has manifested in the present)
- Length of treatment: Shorter than PA
# Defenses/Maneuvers
- Symptoms can be thought of defenses
- When treat symptoms, left with what symptom was protecting (Shedler)
