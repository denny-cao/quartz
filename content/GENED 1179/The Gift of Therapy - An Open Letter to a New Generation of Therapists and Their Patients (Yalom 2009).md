# Week 10 (251-259)
## Beware the Occupational Hazards
- Loneliness; intimate one-on-one sessions, but do not provide "nourishment and renewal that emanate from deep, loving relationships with friends and family."
- "Too often, we therapists neglect our personal relationships."
- "cannot abide the fleeting shallow encounters and small talk of many social gatherings"
- "avoid contact with others or conceal their profession because they are put off by the public’s distorted responses toward them"
- "Of all the stresses in the life of the psychotherapist, there are two that are particularly catastrophic: the suicide of a patient and a malpractice lawsuit"
- "If there is no confounding interpersonal incompatibility among the members, a group of experienced clinicians needs no professional leader."
- "A group of less experienced therapists, on the other hand, may benefit from an experienced leader serving both as facilitator and mentor."
## Cherish the Occupational Privileges
- "We take pleasure not only in the growth of our patient but also in the ripple effect— the salutary influence our patients have upon those whom they touch in life"
- "We are cradlers of secrets. Every day patients grace us with their secrets, often never before shared. Receiving such secrets is a privilege given to very few"
- "granted a clarifying lens through which to view the world—a view with less distortion, denial, and illusion, a view of the way things really are."
- "We are intellectually challenged. We become explorers immersed in the grandest and most complex of pursuits—the development and maintenance of the human mind."
- "belong to the venerable and honorable guild of healers"
