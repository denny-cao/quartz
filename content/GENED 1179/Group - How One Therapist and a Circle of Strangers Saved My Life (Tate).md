“Law school could fill all my yearnings to belong to other people, to match my longings with theirs.”

“That was how I’d always imagined the surface of my heart—smooth, slick, unattached. Nothing to grab on to. Unscored. No one could attach to me once the inevitable heat of life bore down. I suspected the metaphor went deeper still—that I was afraid of marring my heart with the scoring that arose naturally between people, the inevitable bumping against other people’s desires, demands, pettiness, preferences, and all the quotidian negotiations that made up a relationship. Scoring was required for attachment, and my heart lacked the grooves.”

“I was a misfit. The deep secret I carried was that I didn’t belong. Anywhere. I spent half my days obsessing about food and my body and the weird shit I did to control both, and the other half trying to outrun my loneliness with academic achievement.”

“In my journal, I used vague words of discomfort and distress: I feel afraid and anxious about myself. I feel afraid that I’m not OK, will never be OK & I’m doomed. It’s very uncomfortable to me. What’s wrong with me? I didn’t know then that a word existed to perfectly define my malady: lonely."

“I could tolerate 12-step groups because the membership at every meeting shifted. You could come and go as you pleased, and no one knew your last name. There was no one in charge at a 12-step meeting—no Queen Bee Bianca who could oust other members. A set of spiritual principles held a 12-step group together: anonymity, humility, integrity, unity, service. Without those, I never would have stayed. Plus, the cost of a meeting was basically free, though they suggested a two-dollar donation. For the cost of a Diet Coke I could spend sixty minutes acknowledging my eating disorder and listening to other people’s pain and triumphs around food.”

“The therapist’s theory is that keeping secrets is a toxic process, so we—the group members—can talk about whatever we want, wherever we want. The therapist is bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, but we’re not.”

“Why would you tell people your business? You must protect yourself!... Telling other people your business was tacky and could have adverse social consequences. She was convinced I’d be ostracized if other people knew I had mental problems, and she wanted to protect me. When I started going to 12-step meetings in college, it took all the courage I had to trust that the other people would take the anonymity part of the program as seriously as I did.”

“To open up, I needed a therapist who could hear the echoes of pain in my silences and see the shirttail of truth under my denials.”

“I didn’t care if he could help me; I cared about whether or not he liked me.”

“A therapist is supposed to be a blank slate. There were smudges all over Dr. Rosen.”

“How could I come across as both witty and tortured, like Dorothy Parker or David Letterman? I wanted this Dr. Rosen to take seriously my newly developed fantasies about dying, yet still find me irrepressibly charming and maybe also a little bit fuckable. I figured he’d be more willing to help me if he found me attractive.”

“The word want echoed in my head. Want, want, want. I groped for a way to speak my longing in the affirmative, not just blurt out how I didn’t want to die alone.”

“I want to be real. With other people. I want to be a real person.”

“He leaned forward. “You want intimate relationships in your life within five years?” I nodded, willing to bear the discomfort of eye contact. “We can do that.”

“If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him,” Dr. Rosen said in our second session when I told him my fears.”

“If you’re thinking about committing to treatment with me, you’re going to start coming up with excuses about why it won’t work.”

“The starving person isn’t hungry until she takes her first bite,” he said.”

"
"How do I ‘let the group in’?”
"You share with them every aspect of your life that deals with relationships—friendship, family, sex, dating, romance. All of it.”
"Why?”
"That’s how you let them in.”
”

"All of your secrets are going to come out.”

“Literally, moments before I admitted as much, but now I was backing away because of messages embedded in my marrow: Nice girls don’t want it. Feminists don’t need it. Good girls don’t talk about it at all, especially in mixed company. My mother would die if she knew I was talking about it with these strangers.”

“You crossed your legs,” Colonel Sanders said. I stared down at my right thigh crossed over my left. Everyone turned toward me.”

“The group room was a fishbowl. There was nowhere to hide from the six pairs of eyes around the circle. They could read my body. Make assessments. Draw conclusions. They could see me. The exposure made me want to cross my legs until the end of the session. Until the end of time.”

“Another rule: “Feelings have two syllables or less: ashamed, angry, lonely, hurt, sad, afraid—” Dr. Rosen explained feelings like Fred Rogers talking to a preschooler. Apparently, once you veer beyond two syllables, you are intellectualizing, effectively darting away from the simple truth of your feelings.”

“What makes you think confidentiality makes you safe?” Dr. Rosen looked energized, ready to school me.”

“You might want to look at why you’re so invested in privacy.”

“It might be, but keeping secrets for other people is more toxic than other people knowing your business. Holding on to secrets is a way to hold shame that doesn’t belong to you.”

“God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”

“Christie, why don’t you tell the group what you ate yesterday,” Dr. Rosen said.”

“Call Rory every night and tell her what you ate.”

“I’m not trying to keep you from eating apples,” Dr. Rosen said. “Eat as many as you want. The apples aren’t killing you; the secrecy is. And the point is”—he leaned close and lowered his voice—“if you can let this group into your relationship with food, you will be closer to intimate relationships. You’ll start with Rory.”

“Dr. Rosen was a snake charmer. He could ask a pointed question and secrets from our past would slither out. He’d coax Rory into recounting details of her father’s harrowing escape from Poland, urging her to speak in her father’s Old World accent. At Dr. Rosen’s urging, Colonel Sanders described the dubious therapy he had with an unlicensed doctor who treated him for PTSD after his service in Vietnam. Dr. Rosen could get Carlos talking about the stepbrother who abused him after Sunday school, and Patrice misting up over her brother who hanged himself in the family orchard. Dr. Rosen sensed where our shame and grief was hidden and knew how to extract it. He prodded me to talk about Hawaii and bulimia almost every session.”

“You were already committed to doing things alone by age five,” Dr. Rosen said like it was a big revelation, but it didn’t feel like one. When I had pinworm, I was embarrassed—in Rosen-speak ashamed—about being a dirty girl with worms in my butt, worms that weren’t crawling through my brother’s or my sister’s asses. Worms were proof that my body was defective and disgusting. Dr. Rosen pressed me to describe how it felt to be a little girl alone in a fight with an anal parasite.”

“Whatever it was, through the rest of the day, I carried a quiet calm and sense of awe that I could sit with six other people in total silence for ninety minutes.”
