- Race = "adaptive challenge": Gap exists between aspirations and realities of everyday experience
	- => Race in therapy: Problem/opportunity actualized will look different to patient and analyst as function of different loyalties, values, and habits
- Can enhance therapy by considering frameworks from leadership development and from social psychology of racial experiencing
- Dean: Lawyer, well-educated family believed education was economic mobility, father dementia and died, consulting firm, only AA. Prove himself.
	- Transference: Show fear from dad's death
- "Chosen traumas": Ways in which identity groups cohere around shared mental representations of important historical events.
	- "Collective history"
- South Africa White therapist: how do you know problem is about race?
- Racial positioning: When analysts and patients don't really wish to believe that important problems are also about race
- Traditional psychoanalytic theory: Sexuality placed at center with respect to development of personal subjectivity
	- Race, ethnicity, and other identity parameters viewed as "sociology" (not concerning psychoanalysis)
- Racial difference: Powerful trigger and container for projection of unacceptable impulses
- "Anatomy of prejudices": Racists are obliged to racialized Others. Need to keep them close in order to maintain the fiction that disturbing impulses are located outside of themselves
- Relational analysts: Racial identities are fundamentally "melancholic"; racial identity coheres in the behaviors, states of mind, and attachments a person is obliged to give up in the name of being "truly" their race
- These views make race easy to be seen as illusory 
- Racial stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination: Distort developmental trajectories and bankrupt narcissistic investments in the self
- "Adaptive challenge": Exist whenever there is a meaningful gap between bold aspirations and the challenging realities of everyday justice
	- Appear because such aspirations can look different to the different stakeholders who are party to them
	- Solutions to them look different to different people -> Requires stakeholders to change their priorities, beliefs, habits, and loyalties to make progress
	- Obama race speech March 2008: Henry Louis Gates, spoke that it was racist, faced with criticism, forced to apologize. Shows perspective that a Black person in power can shed light on.
- Analytic loyalties to be renegotiated include how we, as psychoanalysts, understand large group identities; the legitimacy accorded the role of public environments in shaping individual subjectivity, and the utility of insights arising from empirical social science
- Academic testing is one venue where stereotype threats are easily trigged because of the negative stereotypes that exists about Black intellectual capacity
	- Obama's election may have increased sense of competence and agency among AA and reduced test-taking anxiety -> better performance
- "Aversive racism": Persons who consciously hold nonracist values, but when assessed on a standard measure of implicit attitudes, show evidence of implicit attitudes biased towards favoring Whites
	- Blacks with aversive racists are least effective at problem solving, even more so to prejudiced Whites
		- Possible explanation: Mixed messages. Words and actions show two different things, causing additional cognitive load -> Work less efficiently
- Implicit attitudes, malleable? 
	- Imagined contact results only when participates actively engage the simulation, when the contact they fantasize is positive, and when participants focus on themselves enjoying the contact, rather than on the experience of the other
- Implications in therapy
	- Dean: Aversive racism with colleagues
	- Substantive change; need to take an authentic accounting of the social psychology of racial experiencing
