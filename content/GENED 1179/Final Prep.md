# Course Overview
## Psychodynamic Mind
- Model of mind: Id, ego, superego
	- According to Freud, developed from his theory of psychosexuality in relation to Oedpius Complex
	- Id: Basic, primal part of personality present at birth wanting to satisfy unconscious urges (Eliminate father)
	- Ego: Reality; mediate urges of id and demands of reality (Develop when realize father is much stronger)
	- Superego: Resolve castration anxiety, Inner moral authority that is an internalization of father figure that strives to suppress urges of id and make ego act upon idealistic standards (Where child retains character of father and Oedpius complex repressed -> Emergence of conscience and overall sense of right and wrong)
- Theory of pathology
	- Psychodynamic mind focuses on internal conflict
- Theory of therapeutic action
	- Talk therapy; let unconscious flow
	- Relationship---Transference
## Cognitive-Behavioral Mind
- "Schemas": How we understand/construct reality
- Focus on relationship between mental representations of the world and "reality"
	- **Schema:** A cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information; memories, beliefs, emotion
	- Usefully allow us to process vast amount of information quickly
	- At same time allow us not to see what doesn't fit the schema
### Cognitive Errors
Different forms of thinking that get people into trouble

**Overgeneralizing:** If true in one situation, true in all
**Selective Abstraction:** The only events that matter are the failures, which are sole measure of myself
**Excessive Responsibility:** I am responsible for all bad things, rotten events, life failures
**Self-references:** I am the center of everyone's attention, especially when I fail
**Dichotomous Thinking:** Everything is all bad or all good

Think about world in wrong way. Therapist will tell that reality is different from thinking -> Correcting cognitive errors -> Feel better
## How to determine what is effective?
Rosenzweig 1936: Dodo bird verdict
- Measuring psychotherapy outcomes
- Critiques of this
- CBT is gold standard
Common factors: What really matters in psychotherapy is relationship that the therapist has a good relation, good personality, follows a system and that **any system of psychotherapy can lead to a good outcome that we might not know what leads to a good outcome**
- Shedler says the common factor is relationship
- PPT: Relationship captured by transference
- CBT and beyond in research world: Captured by working allaince
## Transference
Responding to another person as if they were someone from your past; for example, punishing someone in the present for wrongs someone else did to you when you were growing up.
- Becomes operationalized for science in form of working alliance
- Working alliance in Woebot
- Working alliance inventory short revised WISR as measure of bond that users form with Woebot
- Woebot efficacy: Isn't that will reduce symptoms, but that you can form a bond with it
## Repetition and Enactment
When something we do not want to know or understand about ourselves gets played out with others over and over

## Peter Carnegie Outcome Study
PPT more effective in long term two years after end of treatment than CBT or treatment as usual
- Other research out there; isn't the only thing that works
## Basic Principles of Cognitive Therapy (Beck)
- Mental disorders are **thinking disorders**
- Thoughts influence mood
- If patients can be taught to restructure thoughts, mood will improve
- Cognitive triad
## Attachment Styles
- Secure, avoidant, anxious, disorganized (Last three are insecure attachment styles)
- Importance of child rearing
- Behaviorism
	- Pavlov and dogs
	- Beck started here and added cognition
	- Stimulus and response
## Family Therapy
Process/System over the individual as site of intervention (Family and group therapy)

Families all have:
- Structure
- Boundaries
- Alliances
- Coalitions
- Triangulations

- Decenter problem and symptom bearer
- Behavior is not individual but sustained by the system
- Explore family patterns that maintain symptom
- Explores what each brings from past that influences present

What are families doing that helps maintain the identified patient's symptoms?

Who is the identified patient? Why is someone going to therapy when the whole family is screwed up?
- Label one person as the problem
- Rather than look at one person, look at how the whole system maintains itself
- Homeostasis taken from cybernetics
- Same model in group therapy 
- Systems perspective: Want to maintain homeostasis; systems don't like change. Families that are pathological don't like change. Maintain it by maintaining that one person is sick
## Process v. Content
Process specifically important in group therapy
- Asking why someone is doing what they're doing or saying what they're saying at the moment rather than what they are saying
- How are they saying, what emotional load are they saying it? Why are they saying that then?
- Ex. Someone always interrupts. Rather than say he is being rude, get at why they feel compelled to always interrupt when we're getting focused on someone else
## Therapy for All
- Discrimination in therapy
	- Black patients hard to get appointments because therapists don't answer their calls
	- Assumption that exemplary patient is YAVIS
	- Discrimination at the **point of entry** not just within treatment
- Audit studies
- Black psychoanalysts speak: 
# Conversion Therapy
- Theory that has bene completely disavowed by every American therapeutic organization
- Aim: Change sexual orientation or gender identity
- Method: Aversion, behavioral 
	- Exposure (Nausea inducing drugs, electric shock)
	- Historically: Chemical castration (Alan Turing)
- Discredited: Ineffective, cannot change orientation
	- Harmful (Suicide, depression) seen as torture
- Not all states disallow it
## Freud and Psychoanalysis: Divided Legacy (Homosexuality)
- Psychoanalysis "opposed to any attempt at separating off homosexuals from the rest of mankind as a group of a special character"
- "All human beings are capable of making a homosexual object-choice and have in fact made one in their unconscious"
- "From the view of psycho-analysis the exclusive sexual interest felt by men for women is also a problem that needs elucidating and is not a self-evident fact based upon an attraction that is ultimately of a chemical nature"
- Heterosexuality an achievement, not a given
## Chatbot Therapy
- Would you open up to a chatbot therapist?
	- Strengths, liabilities or weaknesses of in-person therapy and chatbot therapy
- Eliza (Weizenbaum 1966) Therapeutic model because therapy didn't assume any outside knowledge
- Appeal is in its mimicking of the human
- Interactive, responsive, relational
- Founders recognize this: Therapeutic bond is criterion of success, efficacy
- Support for relationality as central
- **Will AI be able to replicate the human?**
	- Available all the time, access transcripts on demand v. disappearance of words
	- How would you assess whether or not it will enjoy any success?
	- Is it a good substitute? Is it therapy or something else?
- History of psychotherapy: Reducing human factor/replicating the human factor
## Therapy Platforms
- Talkspace, BetterHelp
- Uberization of therapy; hire therapists at very low rates to provide on demand therapy by text or 30, 60, 90 mins a week
- Caught selling patient information, debate on efficacy
- Want therapy transcripts to feed into GAI and then produce responses!
