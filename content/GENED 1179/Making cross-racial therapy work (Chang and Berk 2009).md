Central Question: Whether, how, and under what conditions race matters in the therapy relationship
- "White participants . . . are often concerned about appearing prejudiced, whereas racial minorities are often concerned about being the target of prejudice and/or about confirming negative group stereotypes"
- Several studies: Seeing therapist of dissimilar race or ethnicity -> More likely to drop out of treatment and attend fewer number of sessions v. share racial/ethnic background
- Meta-analytic studies indicated that effect sizes associated with matching are small and matching is not associated with symptom improvements
	- Neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for therapeutic effectiveness, or is mismatching inherently problematic
- studies suggested that other individual and process factors, such as racial or ethnic identity, cultural values, cultural mistrust, therapist cultural competence, and worldview match, are more proximally related to treatment outcomes and may moderate the impact of racial differences
- Multicultural counseling competence accounts for significant proportion of variance in clients' satisfaction
	- Perceptions of therapist's insensitivity and racial prejudice -> Adversely affect minority clients' experiences
		- Minimizing importance of racial-cultural issues to a client of color, pathologizing cultural values or communication style, normalizing potentially dysfunctional behaviors on the basis of an individual's race or cultural group
	- Lead to weaker therapeutic alliance, lower ratings of general and multicultural counseling competence, and lower levels of counseling satisfaction
- Limitations of relying on investigator-developed measures of therapy process
- Differences in how satisfied and unsatisfied participants described therapists were in 2 major areas:
	- Therapist techniques and therapist personality characteristics
## Therapist Techniques
- Active v. passive:
	- Lack of feedback, progress reports, deep questioning -> Dissatisfied (Converse true) 
- Cultural competence: 
	- Capacity to work w/racially or culturally different clients
	- Too textbook and not tailored to client's specific life contexts and histories 
	- Lack of sufficient group-specific knowledge and experience
	- Lack of awareness of dynamics of power and privilege in clients; lives and in therapeutic context
- Self-disclosure:
- Professionalism and ethics:
## Personal Characteristics
- Attentive v. disengaged
- Accepting v. critical
## Etic Elements of Successful Cross-Racial Therapy Relationships
- Clients' summative evaluations may be read as a distillation of what matters most, namely, affective involvement in the relationship and the belief that the counselor is addressing core needs and aiding in the achievement of treatment goals
- Core facilitative conditions (Therapist caring, respect, acceptance. congruence, validation of responsiveness to expressed needs)
- Strong relationship between therapist self-disclosure of personal history and treatment satisfaction
- Ability of the client and therapist to productively communicate and negotiate ruptures in the relationship
## Emic Elements of Successful Cross-Racial Therapy Relationships
- Active and directive role seen more favorably than less directive therapists
- Culture-specific knowledge, skills in navigating racial/cultural dynamics inside and outside of therapy, and awareness of the importance of race and culture in shaping individual experience and identity and criticized those who displayed cultural ignorance or insensitivity
