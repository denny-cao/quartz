Mentalizing: Attending to mental state in self and others, and interpreting behavior accordingly
- Our capacity to relate to each other as persons---as minded beings

How do we know our own mind adn how do we know the mind of others?
- We assume others think the same way we do which leads to a lot of mental health issues
Goal: Accurate Mentalization

Goal: Overcome egocentrism

Comparison to transference: Mentalization is projection of self onto others... Transference is projection of past onto others.
