# Week 3 (3-105)
**Transference**
- Destroys faith in personal relations and explains why they are tragic: we cannot know each other
- Must grope around for each other through a dense thicket of absent others
- Cannot see each other plain
- Freud: Overcome transference by pointing out to the patient that their feelings do not arise from the present situation and do not apply to the therapist, but that they are repeating something that happened to them earlier; oblige them to transform repetition into a memory
- "Irruptions of the id": Anna Freud distinguishes between passionate love and hate transferences
- Ego: More subtle transferences that are the early defensive maneuvers of the ego against instincts
- “a defensive measure—a kind of “prophylaxis” that depersonalized the relationship and interposed a “third person” between the patient and the doctor” 
- 

**Free Association**
- Gave people in therapy complete freedom to examine their thoughts
- “Freud likens the feat of the patient who suspends his critical faculties and says everything and anything that comes into his mind, regardless of its triviality, irrelevance, or unpleasantness, to that of the poet during the act of creation. ”
- Came from a lack of prompting or intervention by a therapist
- Would help with:
	- Transference
	- Projection
	- Resistance
- Counterpart: "Not directing one's notice to anything in particular and in maintaining the same 'evenly suspended attention' in the face of all that one hears"
	- Should be an empty slate; let "unconscious [be] like a receptive organ toward the transmitting unconscious of the patient"

**Psychoanalysis**
- Vast system of thought about human nature
- "Make the unconscious conscious"
- Patient suffers from ignorance, and that if one removes the ignorance by giving them information (about the causal connection of their life, about their experiences in childhood, etc.), they will recover

**Setting: Remnant of the hypnotic model**
- Patient lying on couch, with analyst seated behind
- Continued it because Freud didn't like to be stared at all day, but more analytically:
- Kept "the transference from mingling with the patient's associations imperceptibly" and allowed it to come more sharply into relief as a resistance

**Patient does not remember what is repressed/forgotten, he acts it out**
- Wasn't necessary to struggle against patient's resistance to remembering
- Therapist needs to just observe patient's present behavior
- "Repetition compulsion"
- Task is to convert repetition into remembering

**Structural theory of the mind**
- Ego, id, and superego
	- Id: Natural instincts
	- Ego: Reality
	- Superego: Morality
- Borne from Oedipus complex: Shattering by fear of castration of boy's dream of making love to his mother and formation of the superego as a permanent memorial to his dread

**Structural model: Analyst becomes more passive**
- Manner in which the patient defends themself against analysis becomes itself a focus of the analysis, since the patient's defenses repeat and reflect their characteristic resistances ("defense mechanisms")
- Patient's transferences are classified according to their ego or id origins

**Radical unlikeness to any other human relationship**

**Illusion/Reality**

**Remonstrations against analytic rigidity**

**Being "human" can be harmful**

# Week 10 (106-120)
- “It took on a transferential meaning for me,” he said. “The minute I heard the president’s voice on the phone, I started to tremble. My heart was beating too fast. I was in a bad state of anxiety. All this for a menial administrative job!”
- “I have the impression that there are few true friendships among our members. Only now and then do our interrelationships develop into real friendship.”
- “This is ironic,” I said. “The analyst works with his patients to get them to behave more rationally and reflectively, and remains irrational and unreflective himself.”
- “Analysis isn’t intellectual. It isn’t moral. It isn’t educational. It’s an operation. It rearranges things inside the mind the way surgery rearranges things inside the body—even the way an automobile mechanic rearranges things under the hood of the car. It’s that impersonal and that radical. And the changes achieved are very small. We live our lives according to the repetition compulsion, and analysis can go only so far in freeing us from it.”
- “The people who work well with schizophrenics are people whose center of gravity is a bit displaced, who can make another person the center of their lives, who are endowed with an unusual measure of intuitiveness and sensitivity and kindliness.”
- “I was attracted to psychoanalytic work precisely because of the distance it would create between me and the people I treated. It’s a situation of very comfortable abstinence. A situation of not getting involved with the other person, of not taking responsibility for the other person’s behavior, but only for one’s own.”
- “Analysts always suspect themselves of not being in control of the plethora of material coming out of the patient. They are being paid and trusted to perform a therapeutic service, and they are in the dark about certain things about the patient.”
- “Analysts keep having to pick away at the scab that the patient tries to form between himself and the analyst to cover over his wound. That’s what the patient keeps trying to do—it’s what’s called resistance—and what the analyst won’t let him do. The analyst keeps picking away at the scab. He keeps the surface raw, so that the wound will heal properly”
- “You get infected yourself. Nobody talks about that except in the realm of jokes. You detoxify it by making jokes about it. That’s the defensive aspect of joke-telling. People tell jokes, you know, about how crazy psychoanalysts are—they’ve had analysis themselves, right? Or: Analyst says to another analyst, ‘How are you?’ and the other analyst says, ‘I wonder what he meant by that.’ That kind of joke about the psychopathology of analysts has hidden in it a profound statement—namely, that it’s work that drives people crazy. Yes, it’s unhealthy work.”
- “I realized that the patient had developed an erotic transference to me and was defending herself against it by making herself uninteresting and dreary—as she had done throughout her childhood with her father, and as she was doing in adult life with the men with whom (for some strange reason) she could never get into any sort of satisfying lasting relationship.”
- “And slowly the whole issue of her sexuality and her relationships with men and her attitude toward her father began to emerge. She began to remember rather than act out her vengeful coldness and sexlessness toward her father. And I, of course, stopped being sleepy”
- “Don’t treat these transferences differently from any others. Don’t disabuse the patient who idealizes you. Don’t reprove the person who ignores you. Let these transferences develop. Don’t cut them short through premature interpretation. You will be better able to tolerate your anger and frustration at being treated as a non-person and your discomfort at being idealized if you understand that these are manifestations of the patient’s pathology rather than attempts to subvert the analytic process.’ This was a good thing to say. It needed to be said.”
