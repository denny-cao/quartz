"The idea is to use natural-language processing (NLP) to identify which parts of a conversation between therapist and client—which types of utterance and exchange—seem to be most effective at treating different disorders."

"The aim is to give therapists better insight into what they do, helping experienced therapists maintain a high standard of care and helping trainees improve. Amid a global shortfall in care, an automated form of quality control could be essential in helping clinics meet demand."

"Ultimately, the approach may reveal exactly how psychotherapy works in the first place, something that clinicians and researchers are still largely in the dark about."

"personalized mental-health care"

"A fingerprint for a session can show how much time was spent in constructive therapy versus general chitchat. Seeing this readout can help therapists focus more on the former in future sessions, says Stephen Freer, Ieso’s chief clinical officer, who oversees the clinic’s roughly 650 therapists."

"About [one in five](https://psyarxiv.com/mjg72/) of us has a mental illness at any given time, yet [75%](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413196/CMO_web_doc.pdf) of mentally ill people aren’t receiving any form of care."

"The pandemic has [exacerbated](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/16/1028580/pandemic-mental-health-new-normal/) the problem but didn't create it. The issue is fundamentally about supply and demand. The demand comes from us, our numbers swelled by one of the [most taxing collective experiences](https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/pandemic-technology-project) in living memory. The problem on the supply side is a lack of good therapists."

"Ieso thinks it can increase access to care and use AI to help manage its quality."

"Ieso is one of the largest providers backed by the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) that offer therapy over the internet by text or video. Its therapists have so far delivered more than 460,000 of hours of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)—a commonly used and effective technique that helps people manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave—to around 86,000 clients, treating a range of conditions including mood and anxiety disorders, depression, and PTSD."

"In theory, using AI to monitor quality frees up clinicians to see more clients because better therapy means fewer unproductive sessions"

"In the US, Lyssn’s clients include a telehealth opioid treatment program in California that wants to monitor the quality of care being given by its providers. The company is also working with the University of Pennsylvania to set up CBT therapists across 
Philadelphia with its technology."

"Dean Repper, Trent PTS’s clinical services director, believes that the software could help therapists standardize best practices."

"The point of the AI is to improve human care, not replace it."

"One problem with making psychotherapy more evidence-based, though, is that it means asking therapists and clients to open up their private conversations. Will therapists object to having their professional performance monitored in this way?"

"The algorithm learned to discern whether different phrases and short sections of conversation were instances of specific types of CBT-based conversation—such as checking the client’s mood, setting and reviewing homework (where clients practice skills learned in a session), discussing methods of change, planning for the future, and so on—or talk not related to CBT, such as general chat."

"The researchers showed that higher ratios of CBT talk correlate with better recovery rates, as measured by standard self-reported metrics used across the UK."

"They found that more of what they call “change-talk active” responses... were associated with greater odds of reliable improvement and engagement."

"One intriguing possibility is to use the tools to look at what therapists with especially good results are doing, and teach others to do the same. Freer says that 10 to 15% of the therapists he works with “do something magical.”"
