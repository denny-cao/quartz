# Dialectical (Hegel's Dialectic)
Two opposing ideas can be true at the same time:
- Thesis: Intellectual proposition
- Antithesis: Negation of the thesis, a reaction to the proposition
- Synthesis: Solves the conflict between the thesis and antithesis by reconciling their common truths and forming a new proposition
Reality is not static

Individuals get stuck in polarities, can't move to synthesis

# Linehan: Dialectical Perspective
- "Contradictory truths do not cancel each other out or dominate each other, but stand side by side"
- Within dysfunction there is function
- Within distortion there is accuracy
- Within destruction can find construction

"Wisdom within contradictions"
- How to understand meaning of patient's behavior in the present
- **Individuals both accept selves as they are AND accept that they need change**
# Acceptance and Validation
- Cues from Zen Buddhism: Acceptance of feelings and situations rather than change - radical acceptance
- DBT: Patients' environments have been invalidating
	- Caretakers respond inconsistently and inappropriately to patients' "private experiences"---their "thoughts, feelings, and sensations"
- Environments also either underreact or overreact
- "Acknowledge their behavior made sense: Thoughts of death were sweet release given what they were suffering."
# Therapies and Disorders
Psychoanalysis: Hysteria, obsessionality---neurosis, depression, characterological disorders, problems in living, just about everything
CBT: Depression, just about everything
DBT: Suicidality, BPD
# BPD: Core Features
- Emotional hyper-reactivity and resultant dysregulation
	- "Emotional hemophilia"
- Intolerance of aloneness
	- Fears of abandonment
	- Roots in traumatic childhood attachment patterns

# CBT v. DBT
- DBT: Acceptance and validation of behaviors and dialectical process (acceptance and change) 
- CBT: Focus on change

- CBT: Focus on truth/falsity
- DBT: No final truth
## Commonality
- Focus on problematic thinking:
	- Overgeneralization
	- Inappropriate attribution of blame---self or others
	- Catastrophizing
	- Selective attention to negative events 
# Emotion Regulation
Emotions are: "brief, involuntary, full-system, patterned responses to internal and external stimuli"
- Emotional vulnerability in BPD
	- Baseline: "Very high negative affectivity"
	- Sensitive to emotional stimuli
	- Intense response to emotional stimuli
	- Slow return to baseline
# Roots of difficulties with emotions
- Children grow up not knowing feelings (Invalidating environment)
	- Not knowing how to get attention from environment
	- "Persistent discrepancies" between own feelings and what others say feelings are
- Negative emotions
	- Denied, trivialized
	- Linked to personal failings---lack of drive
- Chaotic interpersonal relationships
# What are emotions? What do they do?
- Communicate to self and others
- Motivate action, overcome obstacles
- Convey information about situation, people
## How can we regulate them?
- Observe and describe
- Chain analysis of problematic behavior
- Emotion diary
- Distress tolerance skills
