**“Mini” research paper**_**:**_  Choose a question about psychotherapy that has arisen in the course of the semester and that interests/intrigues/puzzles you.  The question should be one you can address in a short, 4 to 5-page essay.  You will need to consult at least 3 sources (articles, books, websites, etc.) in providing an answer to your question, and you will need to properly cite these sources as well. You must use at least a few direct quotes--i.e., quotes in quotation marks--from each source. In addition to your 3 outside sources, you are welcome (and encouraged) to draw from course readings. 
**Example questions to consider (please come up with your own question):**

1. Is therapy with someone whose identity (race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, etc.—choose one) matches yours necessarily better than therapy with someone different from you?
2. How does Woebot (or another AI therapy resource) compare to in-person PPT, CBT, DBT, etc.? How does it differ?  
3. Why do therapists seek supervision?  What do they gain from it?
4. Why is CBT still considered the “gold standard” in therapy world?

What are the unique challenges and opportunities for providing psychotherapy to marginalized or underserved populations, and how can therapists adapt their approaches to meet the specific needs of these clients?
What role does the therapeutic alliance play in predicting treatment outcomes in psychotherapy, and how can therapists foster a strong alliance with their clients?
What are the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating technology-assisted interventions (such as smartphone apps or online platforms) into psychotherapy practice?
