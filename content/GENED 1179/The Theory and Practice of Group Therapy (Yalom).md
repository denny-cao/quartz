*Efficacy of group theory v. individual?*
# Chapter 2: Interpersonal Learning
Group therapy analogue of important therapeutic factors in individual therapy such as:
- Insight
- Working through the transference
- Corrective emotional experience
Also represents processes unique to group setting that unfold only as a result of specific work on part of the therapist
## Importance of Interpersonal Relationships
Attachment behavior for survival and it is core, intrinsic, and genetically built-in
- Mother-infant pair (Anxiety when separated)

Rate for almost every major cause of death is higher for lonely, single, divorced, and widowed. Social connection and integration have a positive impact on the course of serious illnesses such as cancer and AIDS.

Sullivan: 
- Personality is almost entirely product of interaction with other significant human beings
- Almost a basic need: Be closely related to others (Equally necessary to survival during infancy)
- Children: Develop traits that are approved, remove/deny traits that are not for security
- Eventually develop concept of the self based on these perceived appraisals of significant others

Grunebaum and Solomon: Continues through development cycle; satisfying peer relationships and self-esteem are inseparable concepts in adolescence
- Even elderly; never outgrow need for meaningful relatedness

Parataxic distortions: Distorting perceptions of others (relates to another on own beliefs of person)
- Differs from transference:
	- Scope is broader: All interpersonal relationships
	- Theory of origin is broader: Not just real-life figures from the past, but also distortion of interpersonal reality in response to intrapersonal needs
Schema: Internal working model formed from early experiences that shapes individual's attachment patterns throughout life

Parataxic distortions are self-fulfilling: Individual believes others will respond in a certain way, and then behaves in manner to evoke that response

Consensual Validation: Comparing one's interpersonal evaluations with those of others
- Sullivan: Can be used to modify interpersonal distortions

The goal shift from relief of suffering to change in interpersonal functioning is an essential early step in the dynamic therapeutic process

Interpersonal and relational focus is a defining strength of group therapy. The emphasis on the client’s understanding of the past, of the genetic development of those maladaptive interpersonal stances, may be less crucial in group therapy than in the individual setting where Sullivan worked.
## The Corrective Emotional Experience
Corrective emotional experience "is to expose the patient, under more favorable circumstances, to emotional situations that he could not handle in the past. The patient, in order to be helped, must undergo a corrective emotional experience suitable to repair the traumatic influence of previous experience."

Change both at the behavioral level and at the deeper level of internalized images of past relationships does not occur primarily through interpretation and insight but through meaningful here-and-now relational experience that disconfirms the client’s pathogenic beliefs

These basic principles—the importance of the emotional experience in therapy and the client’s discovery, through reality testing, of the inappropriateness of his or her interpersonal reactions—are as crucial in group therapy as in individual therapy, and possibly more so because the group setting offers far more opportunities for the generation of corrective emotional experiences. In the individual setting, the corrective emotional experience, The Corrective Emotional Experience valuable as it is, may be harder to come by, because the client-therapist relationship is more insular and the client is more able to dispute the spontaneity, scope, and authenticity of that relationship.
- No such simulation is necessary in the therapy group, which contains many built-in tensions—tensions whose roots reach deep into primeval layers: sibling rivalry, competition for leaders’/parents’ attention, the struggle for dominance and status, sexual tensions, parataxic distortions, and differences in social class, education, and values among the members.
- But the evocation and expression of raw affect is not sufficient: it has to be transformed into a corrective emotional experience. For that to occur two conditions are required: (1) the members must experience the group as sufficiently safe and supportive so that these tensions may be openly expressed; (2) there must be sufficient engagement and honest feedback to permit effective reality testing.
