**Objective of 3D modeling of [[Articulated Objects]]:** Understand shape and motion of the articulated components, represent the geometry and mobility of object parts, and create realistic models that reflect articulated objects in the real world.

# Abstract
Survey provides overview of current state-of-the-art in 3D modeling of articulated objects, focusing on task of articulated part perception and articulated object creation (reconstruction and generation).

# Introduction
**Articulated part perception**: Detection and segmentation of the articulated components of an object while estimating the articulation model that describes the kinematic structure of the object.

**Articulated object creation**: Reconstruction and synthesis of parts into a compositional and hierarchical 3D model that reflects real-world object that can be interacted with.
