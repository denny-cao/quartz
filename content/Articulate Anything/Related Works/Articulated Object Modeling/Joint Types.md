Examples:
- Laptops are [[Articulated Objects]] with a **revolute** joint connecting the screen to the keyboard which allows for screen to rotate around a single axis relative to keyboard, with range of motion being restricted to specific limit.
- Human body has a wider variety of joint types, such as ball-and-socket or spherical joints which allow for motion beyond linear translation or rotation, enabling a more diverse range of movements.
