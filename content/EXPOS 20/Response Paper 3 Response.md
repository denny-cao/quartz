Weathering With You offers a perspective of how the older generation leaves the issue of climate change for the future who are then forced to live in a world that they did not create and forced to take on the burden of fixing it. In the film, in contrast to many other climate fiction bildungsroman, the young couple chooses themselves over the environment, offering a new perspective of the younger generation choosing to live and adapt to the climate crisis rather than solving it
