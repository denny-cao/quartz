In this first unit, we will read poetry that we might define as “ecopoetry” and perhaps that seems to think at least in part about the future of the climate crisis. In his essay on ecology and poetry, Forrest Gander asks what ecopoetry can show us about the environment:

Can [poetry] display or be invested with values that acknowledge the economy of interrelationship between human and nonhuman realms? Aside from issues of theme and reference, how might syntax, line break, or the shape of the poem on the page express an ecological ethics? (_Redstart: an Ecological Poetics_, p. 1-2).

In your reading of your poem you will be asking this same question, along with others that arise from the poem itself. More specifically, you will say what, in this instance, syntax, or a line break, can tell the reader about how this poem imagines, or creates, or questions relationships between the human and the nonhuman world.

He wrote it from the 19th to the 21st of September of 1819, in Winchester, in the southern part of England.
- The work marks the end of his poetic career, as he needed to earn money and could no longer devote himself to the lifestyle of a poet. A little over a year after the publication of "To Autumn", Keats died in Rome.
