# Why CS?

One day after a long day of work, my dad surprised me with a new laptop—a Fujitsu Lifebook LH531. I would carry it with me everywhere. The books on the rudimentary desk setup—an empty pail of Kikkoman soy sauce for a chair and a large white freezer for a desk—were replaced with pdf files on my laptop. At night, I would secretly stay up past my bed time, playing flash games.

That laptop was the catalyst to my interest in technology. I wanted to know how games worked. I wanted to know how, with just one click, I could gain access to the "internet" and find anything I wanted, from John Cena highlights to free versions of my favorite book at the time, The Cat in the House. My old Fujitsu was actually what I used to make my first "Hello World" in Java.

CS opens up an entirely new world of creativity, letting me use what I love—technology—to build anything I want. With just my computer and keyboard, I can make an impact on the people around me and help them. Recently, I began helping Ms. Smith, my precalculus teacher, with renovating the website of her nonprofit, Philadelphia Trail Club. My friends and I are aiming to make the website more accessible for the elderly—what the club is aimed towards—while improving on the overall look of the website.

Its also exciting to be a part of a field where new innovations and discoveries are being made every day. In CS, you are constantly working to create the future. Currently, I am interning at the GRASP Lab at Penn and working closely with a graduate student in the field of robotic manipulation with his research in extrinsic contact estimation. This research will help lead to the future where robots can either match or surpass the dexterity of humans to do tasks.

For my tenth birthday, I received a 3x3 Rubik's Cube in the mail. I was immediately hooked, turning random faces, hoping that it would somehow solve it, only for it to end up being more scrambled than before. I loved thinking about how to solve it, and it became a routine after coming home to fiddle with it until finally, I solved it—well, one side. The satisfying click after making the final rotation made it worth all the effort. Filled with joy, I ran around the house, showing the cube to my brother, my mother, my father while exclaiming “I solved it!” It was the best feeling in the world, putting in so much effort and finally being able to obtain the goal I was reaching for. The few weeks I had spent on it did not matter; I solved it. After then, I fell in love with puzzles—with problem-solving.

  
# Robotics

Why robotics?
- Learn a lot
- Friends, get to know SLA people
- Why am I important?
    - Contributions: Field elements, suggested idea for using computer vision for fitness tracker app
    - Big difference in experience from freshman year to junior year
       - Maybe COVID, maybe switching from FRC -> FTC
       - New leadership role, hope to restore the competitive spirit
           - Manage social media, get sponsorships -> Allow us to do stuff and win
           - Entrepreneurship award

Robotics has always been one of my favorite clubs. In 9th grade, I joined with no knowledge of engineering or how to program a robot. As freshmen, we were delegated to creating field elements—props the team would use for practice. We learned about the use cases for different tools to cut wood and metal, from the chop saw to the frightening band saw. It also opened me to get to know new people, as our team is a joint between Masterman and SLA. I met some of the most brilliant high schoolers I know from SLA, and also a lot of my current friends as we learned and laughed together cutting wood. I relished the robotics days building things, staying until it was dark at 7:00.

After quarantine, there seemed to be a major shift in the way robotics was ran. Gone were the long hours, the competitiveness, the feeling of actually contributing to something important. There seemed to be less effort overall, with not many people caring because we weren’t competing due to COVID. This affected me as well. My interest in the robotics club dwelled. When it came time to select new leadership, however, I realized that it was an opportunity to bring back what we had in freshmen year. I won the position for marketing and business, and I have many ideas of how to restore the collaborative and competitive environment that was present before. I hope to use social media as a platform to attract new members. I want to reach out to get sponsorships for our club and get resources to allow members to have limitless imaginations. I voiced my concerns with the rest of leadership, and we all agree that a lot must change this year. I am excited for the revival of the robotics club, of SLAM being a top team in the competition.

When I was in 4th grade, even though I wasn't physically able to help out my parents at the restaurant with the cooking, I found another outlet to make their lives easier; I used my laptop and set up a Google My Business for our restaurant, Xin Xing House so it was easier for customers to find. A few years after we sold the restaurant, my mother opened up a nail salon. I did the same, setting up the business so it was searchable on Google, adding in the prices for services, and handled communication about closures when we were in quarantine.

# Adjectives
Inquisitive
Adventurous
Striver
Corrigible
Heuristic
Growth mindset
- Maxey, 1% better than yesterday
- Public speaking and coming out of my shell
- Running
- Learning, calculus and other topics... Not just how to solve a problem, but why does that method work?
- 55 in calc -> Avoid that

## Growth Mindset

I want to be the best version of myself, and challenge myself to do better, no matter what it is, whether its running, or school work. When I talked with you after not completing my math homework because I procrastinated, I made pact with myself that I would never let something like that happen again (Of course, after sulking for a while). This summer, I am trying to work on my habit of procrastination. I started using Google Calendar to mark deadlines and important events, which is really helpful while managing an internship and MOSTEC. I started making to-do lists, completing small chunks of assignments every day. For my internship, I set a goal every day and aim to complete it, preventing myself from being too overwhelmed by too much work or letting things pile on until they become unmanageable.

  

As a student, I am constantly learning and challenging myself. Because of this, I open myself up to failure and mistakes—a lot of them. I completely broke the simulation of the franka panda robot arm at my internship. I burnt eggs my first time cooking. I procrastinated and didn't complete twenty of the thirty AP Classroom assignments. Maybe its something about how Gazebo, the robot simulation, works. Maybe its how long I should keep an egg on one side before flipping. Maybe its what I can do to prevent procrastination. Failure is an opportunity for me to learn and grow as a person.

  

## Inquisitive

I silently shut the door behind me as a smile began to form on my face. Screwdriver in hand, I quickly went to work, taking apart my Fujitsu Lifebook AH531 one screw at a time. I popped the back plate off, unveiling the sorcery that had let me play Minecraft with friends at night when I was supposed to be sleeping. It felt invigorating, like I was exploring a deep cave rife with unknowns. I wanted to uncover the unknown, to understand how my laptop worked. It was so cool to see the exposed PCB and the copper heat pipes.

If something was unknown, covered with a black box, while most people would just care that whatever was under it worked, I wanted to unveil what was going on under the hood. I wanted to know what was behind the black box. 


## Brave
  
I’ve always been really quiet, afraid to speak up because I feared being wrong, feared what others thought about me. Since middle school, I’ve been at a constant fight with my self confidence.

It started in sixth grade, when I joined the debate team to improve my public speaking skills. It will difficult; the teams we faced were sometimes extremely aggressive, and I would back down, leaving it all to my teammate to rebut their arguments. I always chose to be speaker 1, so I would just need to read the opening statement, ask a few questions about their argument, take notes for my summary, and sit back for the grand crossfire. Around this time, I decided to run for middle school treasurer, forcing me to go up and speak. My hands were shaking when it was my turn to speak, but I was able to tell my story about selling sparklers to get enough money to buy Yu-Gi-Oh card packs. I didn’t win, but it was a really good experience for me.

In seventh grade, I continued debate. I started to speak up more for the grand crossfire and holding my ground without needing to rely on my teammate. In eighth grade, I made a bold decision to become speaker 2. I learned to be more confident, pointing out flaws in opponents’ arguments. Calder and I won second place in a debate tournament, and the trophy is still displayed in my living room shelf. 

During quarantine, I continued debate, this time with Eric (He left our school D: ) and we alternated speaker 1 and speaker 2. Our record wasn’t the best, but I can confidently say that I wasn’t afraid to speak up. Outside of debate, however, I was still shy as ever. Before school shut down, I rarely raised my hand, fearing I was wrong. During quarantine, it was the same, taking a more passive role in my education. When it was time to share what we discussed in breakout rooms, I would sit silently, praying that someone else would speak. 

Junior year was probably when I started to get out of my comfort zone way more. Maybe it was because it was post-quarantine, and I just wanted to talk to more people. I began talking to people I’ve never met before (from different schools even!). In class, I raised my hand more often than before. However, I was still afraid to ask questions. All my life, I’ve been praised of being “smart,” and for the longest time, I’ve felt that asking questions would make me “stupid.” I felt that asking questions showcased failure. I kept questions to myself and spent a lot of time trying to figure things out by myself. 

Working at the GRASP Lab this summer made me finally realize the importance of questions. Multiple times, I was stuck on things for hours, sometimes even days, and eventually, I would ask my mentor, Leon Kim, for help. Leon would take a quick glance, and in minutes, would figure out what was wrong and what I had to do. Leon told me something many businesses do follow: “fail fast, fail often.” Failing is the only way to learn, and by failing fast and often, you grow quickly, learning from mistakes. Later on in my internship, I became less afraid to ask for help, opening myself
