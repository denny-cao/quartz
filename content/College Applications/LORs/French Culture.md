## Are there any hardships you faced this year or any other year that you overcame?
Coming from immigrant parents that do not speak English and never having gone through the American education system, I had to become independent and search for opportunities to explore my interests on my own. 

I took advantage of the resources Masterman provided, joining robotics to explore STEM. When I noticed a lack of CS education at Masterman (With only one class in 12th grade, and now a 10th grade class that we never had the privilege of taking), I sought to create new opportunities for me and peers to engage in CS through programming club. 

I also looked to outside programs—free programs. As a philomath, I’m constantly intrigued by various topics. However, I never wanted to place a financial burden on my parents, so I opted to not attend many programs I was interested in. I applied to Stanford OHS (Thank you for your rec!), and when I discovered that I didn’t get financial aid, I dropped the program. In 10th grade, when I wanted to get into AI and machine learning, I signed up for an online course, AI Camp, but after realizing that it would cost a lot, I ended up not attending. This year, I found an internship at Penn that finally allowed me to learn about machine learning through robotics research (It paid me too!)

I also applied for MOSTEC (Thanks so much again!) and, as stressful as the program was, I learned so much! When I wanted to get first hand experience with research and learn about robots, 

When I wanted to get into photography, I Googled how much a camera was and lenses, and quickly realized how expensive of a hobby it was. I don’t like asking my parents for gifts because I know that money could be used on necessities, so I found a program that would not only teach me about photography, but would also provide the camera I used last year.

When I wanted to develop leadership skills to encourage my group members to do their fair share on time for a group project and for team management in the future, I searched for business courses and found MGMT004: Work, Power, and Inequality through Wharton’s Pre-Baccalaureate Program.

This year, I wanted to continue learning about calculus, and enrolled in MATH 1410: Calculus II through Penn Young Scholars (Thank you for your rec again!!!). 

My parents’ English skills might be a blessing in disguise, teaching me how to be independent and to take advantage of the resources available to me.



## How can I sprinkle in culture?
- Mention enjoying learning about culture -> Aware of other people
	- Understand their culture better and learn to appreciate them
- Listening to French music and appreciating it 
	- Understanding meanings of lyrics
		- Analyzed one of my favorite songs
- Foods; loved learning about the various foods around the world. I want to try it all so bad!


I'm proud to come out of French 4 with the ability to speak French—although with a limited proficiency. I'm proud that, during my internship this summer, I was able to have a conversation with a visiting student from Canada from the University of Toronto in French (Definitely had to ask him to speak slower and annunciate more!). We went to McDonald's for lunch, and I learned that in Canada, the McChicken was called a Junior Chicken, and what they called the McChicken was a larger sandwich. French allowed me to connect with him, and I felt extremely proud of the progress I had made. "Je m'appelle Denny," and "J'ai dix-sept ans" from French 1. Saying "J'ai faim" instead of "Je suis faim" from making that mistake in French 2. Talking about my goals using le conditionnel from French 3. Finally knowing to use the imparfait instead of passé composé when talking about how I used to play basketball after four years of French. I'm proud of all the French I've accumulated over time, learning from Monsieur Gallagher's songs and whenever you uttered the famous lines, "un peu de grammaire" (Definitely would say they were not the most enjoyable, but my French noticeably improves after learning those grammar rules).

After 4 years of French, I can understand the songs I liked. Not only can I enjoy how they sound, I now can enjoy the more intricate meanings of them after reading through the lyrics and analyzing them. I remember in class when we looked deeper into Stromae’s “Tous Les Mêmes,” and how the music video and lyrics tie together to send a message about how both men and women stereotype each other, and the side of love that is rarely showcased. There’s so many French songs in my playlist that I can figure out the meaning of now (after a long time staring at the lyrics)!

I’m also proud of learning about different cultures. We learned about the slight differences in French spoken around the word (Québécois un chum vs un copain, Les Antilles une doudou vs une chérie, Afrique du l’Ouest payer vs acheter, le Maghreb expression “Zarma!“, etc.), the different music (Louisiane’s “Festivals acadiens et créoles”, France’s “fête de la Musique” to share music around the world), the different cuisines that I really want to try some time (la poutine, le thé à la menthe, Cajun cuisine), and even famous artists like photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand, and I’ve fell in love with his aerial photos capturing beautiful landscapes. Taking French has given me a new perspective, with each “Imaginez” section bringing me into a new culture, helping me to understand and appreciate them more.
