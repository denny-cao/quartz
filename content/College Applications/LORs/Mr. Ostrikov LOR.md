## What did you learn in my class?
I find calculus, and math in general, to be extremely beautiful and elegant. I enjoy how it can be used to explain things. When we learned about derivatives, I recognized the connection to what we were learning in physics at the time; kinematics. It was so exciting to see everything come together. The feeling typing up these notes: 
![constant accel](Pasted%20image%2020221022135814.png)

was probably a fraction of what early physicists and mathematicians felt when they discovered this relationship! The relationship between physics and calculus continued to appear throughout the year, and it definitely made my life easier recognizing them; I no longer had to memorize an entire list of equations‚ÄîI could just take the derivative or integral of one of them!

When we learned about centripetal acceleration, I attempted to make sense of the equation we were told to memorize through what I learned in calculus of vector differentiation:
$$a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}$$

## Why are you asking me to write your recommendation?
I think you know me the best. You‚Äôve seen my growth as a person. I rarely talked in class, facing self confidence issues (I talk about it a little more later) but over time, I grew into myself and found myself teaching programming, helping others in calculus, and talking to more people. Perhaps it was the confidence I gained from understanding calculus? ü§î I‚Äôm now not afraid to ask questions, understanding that, although there are definitely dumb questions, if I don‚Äôt ask them, I will remain ignorant. Asking questions is the only way towards understanding. 

I remember asking about taking limits in 3D space. I watched a few videos online about it, but it still didn‚Äôt make sense. Asking you and talking it out made it make way more sense.

You know my love for programming and problem solving. I started programming to follow the shoes of my brother, but eventually found it extremely fun. There are many different ways to accomplish the same task, but there are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù solutions than others. I love finding ways to optimize run time and memory.
## What did you contribute to my class?
I enjoy helping others. 

When we had class on the fifth floor in Zimny‚Äôs room, I frequently helped Calder understand the topics we were covering in class, helping him through the practice problems in class. 

On the days leading up to the AP exam, I helped out a few students understand topics. Michael Samuel reached out for help with area of polar graphs, and I thought of an easy way to conceptualize the equation.

![area of polar graph](Pasted%20image%2020221022175617.png)

I thought of it as approximating the area by using the area of a small sliver of a circle. Not only did it help him understand it, but it strengthened my understanding of it. I love teaching others because of that; I can help others and by figuring out an easy way to explain something, I understand the topic better.

I also [compiled notes of the later subjects for others](https://www.notion.so/akkaro/5-INC-PLEASE-b7a0e3ff37a54761a01bad48c77b6554) before the AP test. Hopefully they helped some people! 

## What sets you apart from the other students in your class?
I have a firm belief that understanding is a better method of learning than memorization. 

When we learned implicit differentiation, it didn‚Äôt make sense for me that we had to take the derivative of every variable, and why we had to multiply by $\frac{dy}{dx}$ every time we differentiated with respect to $y$. I attempted to understand why, and found myself learning about partial derivatives for multivariable calculus, and it finally made sense. We were taking the derivative for the function with respect to $x$ and $y$ and then multiplying each by the change in $x$ and $y$‚Äî $dx$ and $dy$ ‚Äîto get the total change when both variables are changing. 

## What clubs or activities have you participated in?

### Clubs
My most meaningful clubs are programming club, robotics, and track.¬†
I started a programming club as a way to bring people with a similar passion as me together to learn and create things. It's a small group of people, but I think I have been able to bridge the gap in STEM education in Masterman a little by teaching some computer science topics to them. Through programming club, I found a passion for teaching. I enjoyed explaining sorting algorithms, run time, and other CS topics to others and seeing them slowly understand it. A small portion of us are currently working to renovate Ms. Smith‚Äôs website (Thank you for letting us know about it!).

**Robotics** has always been one of my favorite clubs. In 9th grade, I joined with no knowledge of engineering or how to program a robot. As a freshman, I was delegated to creating field elements‚Äîprops the team would use for practice. I learned about the use cases for different tools to cut wood and metal, from the chop saw to the frightening band saw. It also opened me to get to know new people, as our team is a joint between Masterman and SLA. I met some of the most brilliant high schoolers I know from SLA, and also a lot of my current friends as we learned and laughed together while cutting wood. I relished the robotics days building things, staying until it was dark at 7:00.

After quarantine, there seemed to be a major shift in the way robotics was run. Gone were the long hours, the competitiveness, the feeling of actually contributing to something important. There seemed to be less effort overall, with not many people caring because we weren‚Äôt competing due to COVID. This affected me as well. My interest in the robotics club dwelled. When it came time to select new leadership, however, I realized that it was an opportunity to bring back what we had in freshman year. I won the position for marketing and business, and I have many ideas of how to restore the collaborative and competitive environment that was present before. I hope to use social media as a platform to attract new members. I want to reach out to get sponsorships for our club and get resources to allow members to have limitless imaginations. I voiced my concerns with the rest of leadership, and we all agree that a lot must change this year. I am excited for the revival of the robotics club, of SLAM being a top team in the competition.

**Track** has probably been the most important for me. It deepened my love of running, connecting me with others who are far better than me. Every practice, they encourage me to go further or faster, and the meets are always a blast, letting me get accurate times for my runs to measure my improvement. I've had many embarrassing moments, like my DQ after running the 300 hurdles after I couldn't clear a hurdle and fell, and walked around the last one, but I learned to have a short memory and focus on improvement (Although I am definitely never running another hurdle race). I learned to not compare myself to others, and to compare myself to how well I did the previous race. Track has also let me get better at photography. Even though I didn't qualify for championships, I cheered on my team members and took photos of them.¬†

Here are the photos I‚Äôve taken for track: [Outdoor Track - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1LRJD0U-w0V7MYJRtc1is0CpE6KEARQN9)

### Volunteering & Work
I love helping others. Since middle school, I‚Äôve been trying to help out other students by tutoring. In 7th and 8th grade, I volunteered with Chinese immigrants at Chinese Christian Herald Crusades over the summer and taught elementary school kids math and English. At the end of the summer, when they were able to talk to me in English, I felt proud of them and saw the power of education, which led me to continue trying to help others by tutoring. During quarantine, I tutored at-risk students through an online platform, UPChieve, because I knew first-hand the struggles of learning virtually. When we shifted back to in-person school, I occasionally helped Mr. Tannen after school tutoring or just cleaning up because it seemed he had a lot on his plate, with multiple math classes and having a bunch of clubs and basketball. I also became an instructor for a program started by Tino, Roots 2 Success, teaching advanced math to middle schoolers. I think the best feeling was when, at the end, we read through the feedback and some students said I was the best instructor. I love helping out others, whether it's friends who need homework or SAT help, or students I do not know.

This year, **I interned at the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, Perception (GRASP) Lab at Penn** and I‚Äôve been working closely with a graduate student, Leon Kim, and his work on extrinsic contact sensing‚Äîestimating where contacts are happening between a grasped tool and the environment as a robot uses that tool so that we can better control that interaction for assembly and general use tasks. The goal is to eventually surpass the dexterity of our hands so robots can do useful tasks. I‚Äôve been learning so much about robotics (while making some money)! I think the most important thing I‚Äôve learned though is communication and the power of asking questions. I‚Äôve always been quiet, and think that, by asking questions, I end up bothering whoever I‚Äôm asking. After taking an entire work day trying to fix a problem, I asked Leon, and he was able to fix it in a few minutes. I realized that the only way to learn is by asking questions, and that they aren‚Äôt that bothersome‚Äîif they‚Äôre good questions, at least.

## What 3 words would you use to describe yourself?
**Innovative**. I enjoy finding alterative ways to think about things, finding easier ways to explain calculus and physics. I also enjoy creating things. For my program at MIT, MOSTEC, I‚Äôve been working on a robot guide dog, Roselle (Named after a guide dog that heroically saved many people during 9/11), to take a user to a given destination. I CADed it myself, and am currently working on creating an Android app that can connect to it to act as a GPS navigator.

**Brave**. I used to fear failure, and was actually afraid to ask questions in class in fear of appearing ‚Äústupid.‚Äù This has been an issue that I‚Äôve been facing since middle school. I‚Äôve done many things to get out of my comfort zone and build my self confidence. In sixth grade, even though I was in a new school, I decided to run for class representative, and ended up also running for middle school treasurer. It forced me to get up in front of the school and speak, and I took the opportunity to talk about my sparkler selling business to fund my Yu-Gi-Oh card pack addiction. I then joined debate to learn how to express my thoughts and ideas. During high school, I started to become more confident and more willing to fail. I started talking to more people, and gained a leadership position in robotics. During my internship, my mentor, Leon, told me something I will always remember: Fail fast, fail often. Failure teaches a lot. Asking for help doesn‚Äôt make you ‚Äústupid‚Äù‚Äîit makes you smart and efficient, allowing you to fail quicker and learn quicker. 

**Growth-Mindset**. Honestly, failing calculus last quarter was an extremely eye-opening experience. The world was still spinning. It was my first grade lower than an A, and it truly showed how failure can only lead to success. How else would I have learned the importance of not procrastinating, of time management, of prioritizing? 

This summer, I've been using Google Calendar to stay on top of everything I'm doing, marking down times to work, study, read, or even just to relax and have fun. Although I wish I ended the year with all A's, I'm proud of what I learned from my mistake. Had I not gotten that F, I probably would never have had a strong commitment to keep a schedule for myself and learned the valuable life lesson of time management, of not procrastinating. I probably would've been extremely overwhelmed this summer, struggling to balance an internship and a summer program at the same time.

## Are there any hardships you faced this year or any other year that you overcame?
Since my parents do not speak English and never have gone through college education, I had to become independent and search for opportunities to explore my interests on my own.

I took advantage of the resources Masterman provided, joining robotics to explore STEM. When I noticed a lack of Computer Science education at Masterman (why did they just start offering CS as an elective in 10th grade :( ), I sought to create new opportunities for me and peers to engage in Computer Science through creating a programming club. 

I also looked towards free or low-cost programs outside the school. As a philomath, I‚Äôm constantly intrigued by various topics. However, I never wanted to place a financial burden on my parents, so I opted to not attend many programs I was interested in. I applied to Stanford OHS (Thank you for your rec!), and when I discovered that I didn‚Äôt get financial aid, I dropped the program. In 10th grade, when I wanted to get into AI and machine learning, I signed up for an online course, AI Camp, but after realizing that it would cost a lot, I ended up not attending.¬†

This year, I found an internship at Penn that finally allowed me to learn about machine learning through robotics research (It paid me too!). I also applied for MOSTEC (Thanks again for your rec!) and, as stressful as the program was, I learned so much!¬†

When I wanted to get into photography, I Googled how much a camera was and lenses, and quickly realized how expensive this hobby would be. I don‚Äôt like asking my parents for funds because I know that money could be used on necessities, so I found a program that would not only teach me about photography, but would also provide the camera I used last year.

When I wanted to develop leadership skills to encourage my group members to do their fair share for a group project and for team management in the future, I searched for business courses and found MGMT004: Work, Power, and Inequality through Wharton‚Äôs Pre-Baccalaureate Program.

This year, I wanted to continue learning about calculus, and enrolled in MATH1410: Calculus II through Penn Young Scholars (Thank you for your rec again!!!).

My parents‚Äô English skills might be a blessing in disguise, teaching me how to be independent and to take advantage of the resources available to me.

During quarantine, my parents had a difficult time financially, with businesses being forced to shut down, and, even when they reopened, there were few customers. My mom had to close her nail salon. Before then, I helped out by managing social media and advertising, creating the menu with the services offered, as well as posting updates about COVID closures. I also was tasked with filing documents for my parents, as their English is limited. Before helping out with the nail salon, I regularly helped my parents with their legal documents, whether it was with my dad‚Äôs green card, mailing the jury duty request for my mom, or my grandmother‚Äôs life insurance claim (I‚Äôm extremely grateful for everything she gave our family, but I would 100% rather have her alive than the money). When COVID hit, I filed for the PPP loan from SBA, as well as loan forgiveness so the business could continue running. After the nail salon closed, I tried to help out by working at a family member‚Äôs restaurant taking orders. I try to help out my parents whenever possible, as I know that they have a lot of things they have to take care of.
