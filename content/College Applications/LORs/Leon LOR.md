**What was the name of the MIT program/class you were doing concurrently with AEOP this summer and how many hours did you have to dedicate to it per week?**¬†
I was doing MITES Semester, formerly MOSTEC (MIT Online Science, Technology, and Engineering Community), which is a 6 month virtual program. I took 2 courses in robotics and science writing ([More information can be found here](http://oeop.mit.edu/programs/mostec/program-details)). I dedicated roughly 25 hours per week during the summer.

For my two courses, I created a robot guide dog, Roselle (named after a guide dog who led people out of the twin towers during 9/11), as a proof of concept. My idea actually originated from your idea of using an IMU to calculate position. It got me thinking about the various use cases for location, and I thought about GPS navigation. I attempted to create a robot dog that would follow GPS coordinates provided by some map service to get to a destination given by the user through an Android app. This ended up being a little too ambitious, so I have been continuing to work on it after the academic portion of the program.

**Were you interviewing Dinesh for the MIT¬†program, what was the assignment, and what did you end up doing/writing for it?**
For my science writing course, we learned about scientific journalism and were tasked to write an article about a field we were passionate about. I figured that I could write an article about robots and interview Dinesh to understand more about the work being done in PAL. 

While interviewing Dinesh, we talked about what got him interested in robotic perception, and I learned a lot about the current points of interest in robotics. To me, it was extremely interesting how researchers were attempting to replicate human systems in robots, and it got me thinking about how long it would be until robots could become so good at collecting data and making decisions that they would ‚Äúrule the world.‚Äù This became the basis of my article, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x-OjS1bmjNO9lZZsYhytd9m7BflEKQ7uDC6Dbjyx5A8/edit?usp=sharing).
  

**Were you doing any other programs over the summer? If so what were they and how many hours were you dedicating to them per week?**

I wasn‚Äôt working on anything else besides helping my former precalculus teacher build a new website for her nonprofit, Philadelphia Trail Club. Its a hiking club dedicated for senior citizens, and they needed help making the website easier to navigate and more appealing. I spent 10 hours a week. We‚Äôre still working on it. 

**What is the class(es) you are taking at Penn this semester?**¬†
During Spring of 2022, I took MGMT004: Work, Power, and Inequality through Wharton Global Youth‚Äôs Pre-Baccalaureate Program.

This fall, I‚Äôm taking MATH1410: Calculus, Part II (Multivar) with Professor Rimmer through Penn Young Scholars.

**Can you add the department/major information for each college that you plan to apply to (if applicable). Not all colleges may require you to provide an intended major.... And what area within that major/field are you interested in?**¬†

I‚Äôm mainly interested in computer science and EECS if a university offers it. Some business courses seem interesting too.

**Could you also send me your transcript/resume as well?**
Both are attached to this email. 

I don‚Äôt remember if I told you or not but I forgot to do some assignments last quarter for calculus because I was too focused on my final projects for other classes and got an F üíÄüíÄüíÄ
