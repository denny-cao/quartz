# Heimann

Bonjour Madame!

I hope your summer has been going well so far! I just wanted to write this email to provide you with more information about me for my letter of recommendation. 

## What are some interests/hobbies of yours?
**Running.** I'm definitely not the best runner, but I'm proud of the progress I've made. A year ago, while I was sitting at home during COVID, I would never had thought I could run a 5K, let alone a mile. Running lets me tangibility see improvement through distance and time, and its pretty easy to do—a pair of shoes, and that's it. No excuses for not running. When I'm not fighting through grueling pain to try to PR and I'm just taking it easy, its extremely euphoric. I love the occasional leisurely runs down Kelly Drive, as the sun shines and the cool wind from the river blows. It gives me a sense of freedom—a moment where there is nothing on my mind besides my surroundings, listening to the rustling of the leaves and occasionally the lyrics from whatever song I'm listening, whether its Papaoutai (Top tier song to run to, by the way) or Industry Baby by Lil Nas X (Another banger to run to). Recently, its been a way to relieve stress. I go out for a few minutes and run a mile or two to clear my mind, and I come back, ready to work.

**Photography.** I've always been a hoarder. I have a shoe box full of baseball game tickets, plane tickets, amusement park wristbands, and even Halloween cards from 2nd grade when we exchanged candy, like a card with Mator from Cars from Antwan Blassingame (Cool name—totally forgot who he is, though). Photography gives me another way of hoarding, this time with SD cards full of photos from hang outs with friends. I've developed a strange fear of forgetting things, and photography—along with hoarding—lets me look back and reminisce about fun times. It lets me remember smaller, more forgettable events, like the time my friend and I played basketball a day after it snowed—a memory I completely forgot about until I looked through my photo album.

Photography has also provided me with a creative outlet. When I'm not taking candids of my friends when we hang out, I sometimes wander through Center City, taking photos of things I find interesting. It lets me sit back and observe the world around me to look for the perfect moment that captures the feeling and atmosphere at that time. I also cannot draw for my life, and even though I've been playing instruments for nearly half my life, I still suck and struggle to produce a good sound on the violin. Photography has made me realize that I have at least some artistic ability within me. It has also been a way for me to make some money. My friend's parents' friend recently asked me to shoot their birthday, and I'm excited for this opportunity, as I can get more experienced at event photography while making some money at the same time.

## Are you involved in any clubs? Are you a volunteer? Do you work?

### Clubs
My most meaningful clubs are programming club, robotics, and track. 

I started programming club as a way to bring people with a similar passion as me together to learn and create things. Its a small group of people, but I think I have been able to bridge the gap in STEM education in Masterman a little by teaching some computer science topics to them. Currently, a small group of us are working on renovating Ms. Smith (our former pre-calculus teacher)'s website for her non-profit, Philadelphia Trail Club. 

Robotics has let me work hands on with technology. During my freshman year, we were put through mandatory field elements, the group dedicated to making props that can be used for the team to test the robot. I thought our job was dull, but I learned so much about different tools, from the bandsaw (Which I'm still terrified of) to the table saw. Through robotics, I've met so many new friends, some who are part of my close friend group today. Similar to programming club, robotics has allowed me to connect with students across grades who share a similar interest in creating things. I've even made friends from a different school, SLA, as our robotics teams are joint. During junior year, I noticed a shift in attitude in the team. I remembered during freshman year, we would stay for hours to work. During junior year, our meeting times became an hour long, and many people seemed to lose motivation. I now have a position as Marketing/Fundraising Manager, and I hope to draw in a lot of new members from the upcoming freshmen and raise enough money to fund the visions they have for their robots. I hope to use my voice to rebuild the culture we had before the pandemic, so more people are actively engaged in building their robots for competitions.

Track has probably been the most important for me. It deepened my love of running, connecting me with others who are far better than me. Every practice, they encourage me to go further or faster, and the meets are always a blast, letting me get accurate times for my runs to measure my improvement. I've had many embarrassing moments, like my DQ after running the 300 hurdles after I couldn't clear a hurdle and fell, and walked around the last one, but I learned to have a short memory and focus on improvement (Although I am definitely never running another hurdle race). I learned to not compare myself to others, and to compare myself to how well I did the previous race. Track has also let me get better at photography. Even though I didn't qualify for championships, I cheered on my team members and took photos of them. I attached a few to this email!

### Volunteering & Work
I love helping others. Since middle school, I’ve been trying to help out other students by tutoring. In 7th and 8th grade, I volunteered at Chinese immigrants at Chinese Christian Heralds Crusades over the summer and taught elementary school kids math and English. At the end of the summer, when they were able to talk to me in English, I felt proud of them and saw the power of education, which led me to continue trying to help others by tutoring. During quarantine, I tutored at-risk students through an online platform, UPChieve, because I knew first-hand the struggles of learning virtually. When we shifted back to in-person school, I occasionally helped Mr. Tannen after school tutoring or just cleaning up because it seemed he had a lot on his plate, with multiple math classes and having a bunch of clubs and basketball. I also became an instructor for a program started by Tino, Roots 2 Success, teaching advanced math to middle schoolers. I think the best feeling was when, at the end, we read through the feedback and some students said I was the best instructor. I love helping out others, whether its friends who need homework or SAT help, or students I do not know.

During quarantine, my parents had a difficult time financially, with businesses being forced to shut down, and, even when they reopened, there were few customers. My mom had to close her nail salon. I tried to help out by working at a family member’s restaurant taking orders. 

This year, I have an internship at the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, Perception (GRASP) Lab at Penn and I’ve been working closely with a graduate student, Leon Kim, and his work on extrinsic contact estimation—estimating where contacts are happening between a grasped tool and the environment as a robot uses that tool so that we can better control that interaction for assembly and general tool use tasks. The goal is to eventually surpass the dexterity of our hands so robots can do useful tasks. I’ve been learning so much about robotics (while making some money)! I think the most important thing I’ve learned though is communication and the power of asking questions. I’ve always been quiet, and think that, by asking questions, I end up bothering whoever I’m asking. After taking an entire work day trying to fix a problem, I asked Leon, and he was able to fix it in a few minutes. I realized that the only way to learn is by asking questions, and that they aren’t that bothersome—if they’re good questions, at least. 

## Looking back at your academic and personal life, what are some events that you are more proud of?
I leaned back on my chair and blankly stared at my computer—two weeks until midterms. It was freshman year, and my first time taking multiple big tests for multiple classes. I decided—for the first time—to get started early so I wouldn’t have to cram later. That began my daily study of history, with some biology and French studying sprinkled in. Each day, I would read one chapter, make a Quizlet, study it, and then the following day, practice the Quizlet. A few of my friends joined in, and we created a group doc for studying, with notes from every chapter, creating a massive 43-page doc [History Mid Term Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y3Oo3hHkPAvP44IyCjyzKD3NFHnVAk30dMJMtXO7vk0/edit?usp=sharing). We would have daily calls to read the chapters together, and retold the history in funny ways to try to remember it. I still remember singing the 
Chinese dynasties to the tune of Frère Jacques:

Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han,
Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han,

Sui, Tang, Song,
Sui, Tang, Song,

Yuan, Ming, Qing, Republic,
Yuan, Ming, Qing, Republic,

Mao Zedong,
Mao Zedong

That was probably one of the most stressful times in school, but also the most fun, with everyone coming together to study as we laughed over the funny things that happened in history. It was all worth it when I got my test back with a 99%. I had gotten a 99 on a Ms. Vecsi test, notorious for being difficult. I had also gotten high marks on my other tests. I learned how much starting early rather than procrastinating helps (Though I ended up having to go through many consequences—which I write about later—until it finally dawned upon me just how important it was).

_______________________________________________________________________
I’ve always been really quiet, afraid to speak up because I feared being wrong, feared what others thought about me. Since middle school, I’ve been at a constant fight with my self confidence.

It started in sixth grade, when I joined the debate team to improve my public speaking skills. It will difficult; the teams we faced were sometimes extremely aggressive, and I would back down, leaving it all to my teammate to rebut their arguments. I always chose to be speaker 1, so I would just need to read the opening statement, ask a few questions about their argument, take notes for my summary, and sit back for the grand crossfire. Around this time, I decided to run for middle school treasurer, forcing me to go up and speak. My hands were shaking when it was my turn to speak, but I was able to tell my story about selling sparklers to get enough money to buy Yu-Gi-Oh card packs. I didn’t win, but it was a really good experience for me.

In seventh grade, I continued debate. I started to speak up more for the grand crossfire and holding my ground without needing to rely on my teammate. In eighth grade, I made a bold decision to become speaker 2. I learned to be more confident, pointing out flaws in opponents’ arguments. Calder and I won second place in a debate tournament, and the trophy is still displayed in my living room shelf. 

During quarantine, I continued debate, this time with Eric (He left our school D: ) and we alternated speaker 1 and speaker 2. Our record wasn’t the best, but I can confidently say that I wasn’t afraid to speak up. Outside of debate, however, I was still shy as ever. Before school shut down, I rarely raised my hand, fearing I was wrong. During quarantine, it was the same, taking a more passive role in my education. When it was time to share what we discussed in breakout rooms, I would sit silently, praying that someone else would speak. Most times, someone would, but occasionally, I would have to do the unthinkable—speak in class :o. 

Junior year was probably when I started to get out of my comfort zone way more. Maybe it was because it was post-quarantine, and I just wanted to talk to more people. However, I can confidently say that French class drastically helped me get over my confidence issues. Every day, when you said to “parlez avec votre partenaire,” I would have to talk to whoever was my partner for that seating arrangement. I had to talk to people I never talked to before. I remember talking to Harshita about her being absent for a wedding. I remembered talking to Eva about dark room photography. I remember talking to Luiza about music. I remember talking to Grace and Kai about sports, about how Grace was invited to USA Ultimate, about how Kai was the greatest lax player to ever grace the world, about how I swore to never run another hurdle race. In hopes of getting participation points, I raised my hand and spoke a language that I was unfamiliar with. My drive to get a good grade in the class actually helped me become more confident (and improve my French speaking too!). As much as I disliked the assigned seats, I admit that I definitely would’ve sat next to my close friends and would not have had the opportunity to speak to different people. I would’ve never spoke with Oliver, or gotten closer with Max, as we wrote scripts starring Oliver as Jacques. 

## Are there any hardships you faced this year or any other year that you overcame?
Forcefully, I pulled the pop top, creating a satisfying "tsssSSSS" sound—the fourth I heard that night. I had already chugged two cans of Pepsi and a Red Bull, trying my hardest to stay awake through the night. I glanced at the bottom right of my screen—5:00 AM, May 31. Before I could let my eyes drop, I took a large sip of my second can of Red Bull. I winced. It left a terrible after-taste in my mouth. The sun was beginning to wake up, and the birds endlessly chirping their morning song seemed to be taunting me. I had regret all the decisions I had made that led me to that moment. Recording late. Not working on my scrapbook project. Regardless, I had to continue. My grade depended on it.

6:10. I finished uploading our French project to YouTube. I had been up for 24 hours. With that, I fell asleep for a quick 10 minute nap before I went to school and hurriedly finished my scrapbook project during classes and lunch. The moment I got home, I fell asleep. 

I woke up to the sound of my alarm and birds chirping. It was some of the best sleep I had ever gotten in my life. Suddenly, my heart sunk. I scrambled to check my phone—June 1. My math homework was passed due. We were given a load of math homework which I neglected to finish my projects, leaving them for after school. I fell asleep instead. 

That was my first grade below an A since 6th grade—a 55. Thankfully, my overall was still an 86, but it was a far cry away from my previous term grades. I was disappointed in myself, upset and angry at myself for letting that happen. What if I had not gone to sleep? What if I had just drank another Red Bull when I got home? Deep down, however, I knew the root cause of it all was because of my habit to procrastinate. I had never been punished for it, and the F was a costly lesson. I laughed away my anger towards myself, joking about what happened to friends. 

I finally came to gripes with my grade (not really, I still get upset at myself looking at my report card D: ) and decided to never let something like that happen again. I recalled what I had done freshmen year with midterm studying, planning everything ahead on a calendar. I made an active decision to start a habit of time blocking, and keeping it. 

This summer, I've been using Google Calendar to stay on top of everything I'm doing, marking down times to work, study, read, or even just to relax and have fun. Although I wish I ended the year with all A's, I'm proud of what I learned from my mistake. Had I not gotten that F, I probably would never have had a strong commitment to keep a schedule for myself and learned the valuable life lesson of time management, of not procrastinating. I probably would've been extremely overwhelmed this summer, struggling to balance an internship and a summer program at the same time.

## Why are you asking ME to write a letter for you? 
You've seen my growth the most. I think there was a positive correlation between my French ability and my self confidence. I was always afraid of messing up while speaking, but I came to realize that no one really cares, so I started participating more in class, raising my hand to answer questions in hopes of improving my French speaking. Towards the beginning of the school year, I had a difficult time picking between using the imparfait or the passé composé. Over time, from speaking more about what we did yesterday or over the weekend, I began to understand the nuances of the tenses and when to use them. You've seen how I try to learn from mistakes and grow to be a more outspoken and confident student.

You've also seen the effort I put into projects. I love creating things, so whenever there is any sort of creative project, I like to go above and beyond. One of my favorite projects was actually virtual, with me, Evan, and Angela making a video about table manners. Editing the video with Evan was such a blast, and we laughed a lot while trying to record our lines. This year, for the final project, I think I went a little too ambitious. After watching Mr. Borda's campaign video, Angela and I thought it would be funny to try to remake it. It was an opportunity for me to use the photography skills I developed this year, and an opportunity to learn more about videography—something I want to get into. The final project let me, not just showcase the accumulation of things I learned in French class, but also my hobbies. However, the project turned out to be way bigger than I had imagined. Still, I put in a lot of effort and was able to get it done. I'm asking you to write me a letter because you've seen me put in my best effort, even when I'm struggling.

## What are you most proud to have accomplished in my aclass?
- learning the french language 
- person speaking french. could communicate, although I asked them to speak slowly and to articulate more
 ## What do/did you enjoy the most in class?
- definitely not un peu de grammar (although my french noticibly improves after learning those grammar rules)


I'm proud to come out of French 4 with the ability to speak French—although with a limited proficiency. I'm proud that, during my internship this summer, I was able to have a conversation with a visiting student from Canada from the University of Toronto in French (Definitely had to ask him to speak slower and annunciate more!). We went to McDonald's for lunch, and I learned that in Canada, the McChicken was called a Junior Chicken, and what they called the McChicken was a larger sandwich. French allowed me to connect with him, and I felt extremely proud of the progress I had made. "Je m'appelle Denny," and "J'ai dix-sept ans" from French 1. Saying "J'ai faim" instead of "Je suis faim" from making that mistake in French 2. Talking about my goals using le conditionnel from French 3. Finally knowing to use the imparfait instead of passé composé when talking about how I used to play basketball after four years of French. I'm proud of all the French I've accumulated over time, learning from Monsieur Gallagher's songs and "un peu de grammaire" (Definitely would say they were not the most enjoyable, but my French noticeably improves after learning those grammar rules).

I’m also proud of learning about different French speaking cultures: The Quebecois slang we learned sporadically throughout the chapters; the unique aspects of 


## Answer as specifically as you can: What specific school(s) and/or types of schools will you apply to for college?
I'm applying for schools that are well known for strong CS programs, as it is a field that I want to get into. 
The main schools I'm applying for are:
- MIT (Early Action Deadline: November 1)
- Caltech (Early Action Deadline: November 1)
- UC: Berkeley (Deadline: November 30)
- Stanford (Regular Decision Deadline: January 5)
- UPenn (Regular Decision Deadline: January 5)

My full list that I'm still adding to can be found here: [College List](https://akkaro.notion.site/9c535a4a0f36476b884ab8ffb58f96d4?v=7fd368731ba443ce8be85e13460b762b).

## What possibilities do you have in mind for your major subject in college? What would you like/ are you planning to major in?
My passion for CS has drastically increased after my internship, and I definitely want to do something related to robotics or AI in the future. 

## Is there anything I should emphasize on your recommendation?
My growth, both academically and personally. I've made many mistakes, but I always make sure to learn from them. I learn from the mistakes I make on grammar quizzes, mistakes I make when speaking, the math homework I didn't complete. I always try my best, and have learned that asking for help isn't a sign of weakness.
