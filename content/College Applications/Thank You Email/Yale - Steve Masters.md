Hey Steve!

I wanted to again emphasize how thankful I am for our conversation last week; thank you so much for taking time to talk to me, not just about Yale, but about so many topics from making fun of Harvard, to political science, to AI singularity (hopefully it wonâ€™t mean the demise of us humansâ€¦). Talking with you has gave me another insight into life as a Yale student, and Iâ€™m excited even more about the prospect of attending and being part of a community where opinions can be shared and where faculty care about students (it was so cool hearing how you got support while you lobbied for gun control), but more importantly, learning and growing as a person!

Best,
Denny Cao
