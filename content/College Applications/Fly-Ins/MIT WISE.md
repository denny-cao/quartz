### Majors
[Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/research/explore-all-research-areas/robotics/)
[Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-4-artificial-intelligence-and-decision-making/)
[Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-2-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/)

### Curriculum Overview
The majority of EECS majors begin with a choice of an introductory subject, exploring electrical engineering and computer science fundamentals by working on such concrete systems as robots, cell phone networks, medical devices, etc.

Students gain understanding, competence, and maturity by advancing step-by-step through subjects of greater and greater complexity:

-   **Foundation subjects** build depth and breadth in areas ranging from circuits and electronics to applied electromagnetics and from principles of software development to signals and systems. Students must take three or four, depending on their major.
-   **Header subjects** provide mastery within EECS’s subdisciplines: microelectronic devices and circuits; communication, control and signal processing; bioelectrical science and engineering; computer systems engineering; design and analysis of algorithms; and artificial intelligence. Students must take at least three header subjects and one lab.
-   **Advanced undergraduate subjects** enable students to target their degree program toward in-depth mastery of areas matching their specific interests.  Two advanced subjects are required.

Throughout the undergraduate years, laboratory subjects, teamwork, independent projects, and research engage students with principles and techniques of analysis, design, and experimentation in a variety of EECS areas. The department also offers numerous programs that enable students to gain practical experience, ranging from collaborative industrial projects done on campus to term-long experiences at partner companies.

## MEng Program
- 5 year masters
# Questions
## Please tell us more about your cultural background and identity. (250 words or fewer)
- Chinese food → Bullied → Learned about importance of culture
- Poor family; restaurant story
- Immigrant story; hard work and dedication → Me
- Goal: Take care of parents; Chinese culture
- Chinese New Year story → Family importance
- **How has my cultural background influenced me as a person?**
	- Work ethic. GENERIC

- Sparklers → Saving up money to go out as a family → Chinese Restaurant → Hard work → Want children to see Chinese New Years for all that it is  

I ignited a sparkler for the first time, lighting up the darkness that surrounded me and my cousins. Sounds of laughter filled the air, mixing with the sound of drums and cymbals crashing as firecrackers popped, leaving behind trails of smoke. It was my first Chinese New Year dinner with my extended family. 

Chinese New Year is always a special time, a time of reunion. It becomes a time of forgetting the hardships of the previous year, a time for my parents to move past their light nights working to provide for my brother and me, wishing and praying that the next year would be better.

“Shrimp fried rice!” my mom yelled after taking a customer’s order. My dad barked orders to chefs as woks rolled and danced with the dragon’s breath. Chinese New Year was over. Our restaurant opened again and began another year of toiling day till night, from the harsh winter to the sizzling hot summers—what my parents had been doing since they had immigrated to the United States in hopes of a better future. 

My parents always made sure to make time to read to me with the little English they knew. We used to sit on empty pails of Kikkoman soy sauce. Through our small reading sessions together, my parents taught me that education is the pathway to success. Education will be my way of bringing a happy new year to my parents.

- Somehow link education to New Years… Education is key to success in future. New Years is wishing for that…
- Could be story about Chinese New Year → New book

## Why are you interested in attending WISE? (250 words or fewer)

The Banana Lounge—a location that has been sitting on my bucket list to visit since I heard about it. MIT students nailed down the banana to a science, calculating the optimal way to provide as much bananas to students as possible while reducing waste. 

The ingenuity of the students is something I want to be a part of. I want to be a part of MIT’s community, a community of dedicated people driven to be the best that they can be. I want to be a part of a community that isn’t afraid to be different—to be a geek, to pour energy into optimizing banana distribution.

WISE provides the opportunity to cross something off my bucket list (for free as well!). By living on campus for a few days, I’ll be able to experience something a regular tour doesn’t offer: the collaborative environment that MIT fosters. I can witness the best minds collaborate to solve problems, from societal issues to p-sets they still can’t figure out at 2 in the morning. The students selected for WISE will be the future of the MIT community. I can meet prospective students who share a similar drive of learning. 

Most importantly, MIT will let me establish a goal. By going to MIT and experiencing life there, I can set a mental marker and focus on being able to return fall of 2023, but this time, as a student—a member of the MIT community.


## Which MIT major or department is most interesting to you right now?
EECS
## Based on your previous answer, why does it interest you most? How does it contribute to your interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)? (250 words or fewer)
I silently shut the door behind me as a smile began to form on my face. Screwdriver in hand, I quickly went to work, taking apart my Fujitsu Lifebook AH531 one screw at a time. I popped the back plate off, unveiling the sorcery that had let me play Minecraft with friends at night when I was supposed to be sleeping. It felt invigorating, like I was exploring a deep cave, filled with unknowns. I wanted to uncover the unknown, to understand how my laptop worked.

My curiosity led me to learn how to code, opening up a new way of creating things, as well as a doorway into an entirely new world of things I didn’t understand. Recently, I’ve grown interested in robots, and how they can be used to make our lives easier. I interned at  GRASP Lab, where I  about robotic perception and manipulation. EECS will allow me to further pursue my interest in robotics by providing research opportunities, even as an undergraduate, through UROP. MIT has made huge strides in robotic perception, including recent developments in extrinsic contact sensing, something that I am currently working on. 

 EECS has classes that teach skills applicable throughout the STEM field, like data analysis, AI, and programming in general. Not only that, classes in EECS will teach me to solve large problems. In classes, I will have to figure out how to solve difficult problems through logic and reasoning, a useful skill both in STEM and in life.


## Optional: If you could have one superpower, what would it be and why? (100 words or fewer)
4:00 AM. I had pulled two all nighters, having to go to work and then get home to try to finish my final project for MOSTEC. I was left with a mediocre project, a far cry from what I had envisioned just weeks ago. This summer, I learned that there is only so much you can do in a day with only 24 hours. I wanted to sleep, go to my internship and learn, hang out with friends, attend MOSTEC classes, go to the gym, and so much more. If I could freeze time, I could do it all.

## Optional: What is your favorite song that is out right now and why? (100 words or fewer)
The sun shines brightly above, as the cool wind from the river makes its best attempt to blow my hair away. Running has become a recent hobby of mine, and I frequently run along Kelly Drive, bumping my favorite running song: *Industry Baby* by Lil Nas X. When my shins start to burn, begging me to stop, the upbeat sound of the song, with the instrumental sounding like a marching band, inspires me to push through it and go further. 





- That one ad song about dreaming

- Huawei released a banger
	- Dream big, chase them, because they are possible if you chase, reach, fly until you break. run, climb, soar 
	- not until you fall that you fly: failure is needed. you learn from them. move on. fly on.
	- Huawei; never say failure
	- Huawei ringtone → Friend called, going to pick up, but had to let song play
