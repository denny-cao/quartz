## Short Answer #2
_“When trying to solve complex problems, progress often results from diverse perspectives. That is, the ability to see the problem differently, not simply 'being smart,' often is the key to a breakthrough. As a result, when groups of intelligent individuals are working to solve hard problems, [the diversity of the problem solvers matters more than their individual ability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15534225). Thus, diversity is not distinct from enhancing overall quality–it is integral to achieving it." -Dr. Kenneth Gibbs Jr._
