Cornell Engineering, as a land-grant university, approaches education and research in a completely unique manner from others, committing to providing a practical education that prepares students to apply their knowledge to real-world problems. This philosophy is reflected in the CS curriculum, which emphasizes hands-on experience and collaboration with industry partners.

I want to be part of this collaborative environment that combines strengths of different disciplines to find innovative solutions, applying what I learn in the classroom in research at Cornell. At Cornell, I can explore the intersection of CS and robotics—and even linguistics. I continue to wish to research in the Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Controls and continue researching robotic manipulation, but I have also recently become interested in natural language processing. Cornell’s NLP Group is something I wish to further explore. 

Cornell’s Bill & Melinda Gates Hall—home of Cornell CIS—is beautiful. The design of Gates Hall reflects the essence of the information age, integrating technology and architecture, letting in natural light and nontraditional design to encourage collaboration. I long to walk the halls luminated by the sunlight, discussing new ideas—or the most recent p-set—with my peers and even faculty, working towards a brighter future one conversation at a time.

Cornell's CS major is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in the fundamentals of computer science, while also allowing them to explore specialized areas of interest through a variety of elective courses. The program also emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration, with opportunities to work on projects with students and faculty from other departments, such as electrical and computer engineering, information science, and operations research and engineering.

In addition to its academic programs, Cornell's College of Engineering also has a strong tradition of research and innovation in computer science and related fields. Faculty members and researchers are involved in cutting-edge projects across a range of areas, including artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction.
