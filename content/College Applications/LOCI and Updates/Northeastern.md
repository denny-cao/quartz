# Update
To whom it may concern,

My name is Denny Cao, and I am a prospective student from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I want to first express my gratitude to the admissions department for reevaluating my application, providing me with the opportunity to potentially (and hopefully) make Northeastern my home for the next four years. I dream to be part of the collaborative and diverse community shown by how Northeastern has one of the largest international student communities in the nation. I am eager to study at Khoury—which is rooted in so much history being the nation's first college dedicated entirely to computer science—and further explore the intersection of computer science and robotics to make people’s lives easier.

To make a living, many are forced into jobs roboticists describe as the three D's: dull, dangerous, and dirty. At Northeastern, I can work to create a future where assembly workers aren’t forced to quickly repeat dangerous tasks, a future where my parents don’t need to work long hours in summer heat at the restaurant, a future where robots assist humans. Northeastern’s rigorous curriculum, innovative programs, and dedicated faculty members will prepare me to succeed in the field of robotics and computer science, especially with the MSCS PlusOne pathway where I can challenge myself with graduate level courses—such as ME 5250: Robot Mechanics and Control—while completing my undergraduate work and get a head start to a master’s degree in Robotics at Northeastern. 

At Northeastern I can also get a head start on my career through the strong co-op program where I can directly learn through real-world experience. Along with co-ops, I plan to take advantage of Northeastern’s undergraduate research opportunities to further the field of robotics. Currently, I’m interested in working in the Helping Hands Lab to continue researching robotic manipulation and work to make my dream of robots working hand in hand with humans.

I would like to also add a few notable things that have happened since I submitted my Early Action application:

·         **My team, the Ocean Anchor Bankers, are semifinalists in the Wharton Global High School Investment Competition, one of 55 teams out of nearly 1,400 teams competing in 53 countries.** Our investment strategy "anchors" our client, ensuring they will reach their destination even through rough waters—fluctuations in the market. For our video presentation, I filmed a skit where we're pirates, sailing the high seas in search for treasure—our slideshow/pitch. I'm extremely proud of how it turned out! 

·         **Our robotics team qualified for states and competed in the Pennsylvania FTC Championship.** Although we did not win, we did well for our first year competing, and I can't wait to see what the future of SLAM robotics holds. As our season comes to an end**, I'm working on rebranding our robotics team, leading a group to remake our logo, create a website, and write documentation for code and robotics in general that can be added to year by year to help the next year of ambitious roboticists.**

·         **I competed in the MathWorks Math Modeling (M3) Challenge, where we were tasked to model the growth in sales of e-bikes and determine what influences e-bike sales the most in a 14-hour period.** I learned about non-stationary and stationary time series data, Granger’s Causality Test to determine which factors influenced each other, Johansen’s Cointegration Test to determine if a set of time series were cointegrated. After finding variables that showed correlation with each other and had reasonable justifications why they were correlated, I worked on developing a Vector Autoregression (VAR) to model the multivariate time series of data we found for e-bike sales, traffic congestion, and disposable income. I now realize that VAR could’ve also been used for our Wharton Investment Competition! It was a lot of fun; I learned so much about how computer science, statistics, and mathematics could be used in economics (and ran into many issues as well). Mobile ordering from a completely different Chipotle which cost us an extra 10 minutes in driving will remain a fond memory of senior year!

·         **I am a nominee for the US Presidential Scholars Program.**

·         **I was also voted for Best Glow Up in our senior class** :)

I would again like to thank you for taking the time to reevaluate my application. Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide. I’m hoping I can join the Husky community!

Sincerely,

Denny Cao
