To whom it may concern,
My name is Denny Cao, and I am a prospective student from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. First, I
want to express my gratitude to the admissions department for reevaluating my application,
providing me with the opportunity to potentially (and hopefully) make Caltech my home for the
next four years. I dream of being part of the tightknit and diverse community of Caltech where
we can collaborate and learn from each other to take a small step in shaping the future, whether
hands-on through cutting edge research, or working together on problem sets late at night.
I’m currently interested in working at the Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies
which is at the forefront of innovation in robotics—a field I am extremely passionate about—to
continue researching robotic manipulation and explore other areas of robotics to make a future
where human-robot interaction and collaboration is possible.
I would like to also add a few notable things that have happened since I submitted my
application:
• I placed second in the advanced team contest in the annual UPenn Math Contest.
Working together with friends has solidified the importance of collaboration; in my weak
areas, my teammates provided insight, and in theirs, I contributed my own to create
solutions we may not have achieved alone. I applied some topics in number theory,
combinatorics, and set theory covered in my discrete mathematics course such as the
Chinese remainder theorem, and from my teammates, I now know Bezout's theorem!
• For my senior project, I am leading a group to build a miniature bipedal robot and
attempt to incorporate a linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) to allow it to
walk. I was partially inspired after reading about and watching Veritasium’s video about
LEONARDO (Developed at CAST!) that can, not just walk like what we are trying to do,
but can skateboard, slackline, and fly!
• I have been learning how to build a keyboard, from the PCB to the case. My
previous keyboard, an Anne Pro 2 was stolen after I left it behind at the library :( (I had
grown attached to it, as it was where I first learned how to solder after replacing the
switches with Alpaca linears). It’s so cool seeing some of the things I’m learning in AP
Physics E&M in the articles and documentation I’ve been reading.
• After getting tired of restarting my terminal to exit Vim, I have started learning Vim.
Initially, it was extremely annoying and slowed down my workflow, constantly pressing
the wrong hjkl key. Over time though, I have become faster, and it has made coding so
much more enjoyable. I also know how to exit from Vim now :q
• I am self-learning linear algebra through Gilbert Strang’s lectures along with the
problem sets. His teaching places a strong emphasis on intuition rather than
memorization which I like. It encourages you to develop a deeper understanding of the
material, allowing you to apply it more effectively in the real world, whether it’s in
computer science, economics, or beyond.
• I am a nominee for the US Presidential Scholars Program.
• I was also voted for Best Glow Up in our senior class :)
I would again like to thank you for taking the time to reevaluate my application. Please let me
know if there is anything else I can provide.
