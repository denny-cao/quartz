The aqua autumn sea breeze failed to cool me down from the red scorching sun. I tried to ignore it, but the sweat glistening on my forehead hinted at my defeat. Every time my foot struck concrete, the sharp dagger twisted deeper into my abdomen; the side stitches were unbearable. The searing pain in my shins grew more excruciating, their cries for me to stop getting louder. But I couldn’t. My goal was just within reach. My breathing became heavy, gasping for air. I came to a sudden halt. I lost my pride that day—and five dollars.   

“An average person runs a nine to ten minute mile,” my brother, Frank, said doubtfully when I asked if I could run a decent mile.  I scoffed. Easy. I was so confident that I opened my wallet and bet my brother all the money I had—a five-dollar bill.

0.7 miles. I bent over, hands on my knees. Suddenly, a blond-haired kid, maybe four feet and a half, came barreling down, nearly crashing into me, and sprinted off into the distance like a lion chasing its prey. It looked effortless to him, continuing on without breaking a sweat. _There’s no way a fifth-grader is going to beat me_. I ran after him, but the side stitches flared up, silencing all my thoughts. I slowed down to a walking pace until my phone buzzed—I had reached a mile. A slate stone statue of three angels playing music. I set a mental marker; I’m getting here tomorrow.  

0.7 miles—again. _I’m going farther tomorrow._

0.8 miles. _I’m going farther tomorrow._

0.8 miles—again. _I’m going farther tomorrow._

For a few months, Kelly Drive became my new home after school. The torture I put myself through seamlessly became euphoric, with the thoughts clogging my mind being drowned out by the rhythm of my footsteps and my favorite music. Each day, I inched closer to a mile, and when I reached that, closer to a ten-minute mile. 

The last autumn leaf had fallen, leaving all the trees around me barren; winter was approaching. “Double or nothing!” I exclaimed one November morning. Frank had a confused look on his face until he remembered our initial deal. He scoffed. “Sure,” he replied, with the same confidence I had. I smirked.  
  
The sea breeze is friendly. The sun is kind, glistening on the Schuylkill River. The wind picks up various shades of red, orange, and yellow, playfully tossing them around. I have a metallic taste in my throat, but my goal is within reach. In the distance, the angels play their music as Spotify shuffles to Drake’s “God’s Plan.” 0.9 miles at a pace of 10:30 per mile. Gone were the thoughts of controlled breathing, in through my nose, and out through my mouth, the thoughts of how my foot should strike the ground at the midfoot, the thoughts of pumping my arms. I pant, struggling to absorb as much air as I possibly could through short, rapid breaths, inhaling through my mouth and out the same way. My lungs beg for me to stop, but I keep going. My arms flail, feet about to explode.   

Victory buzzes from my phone—1 mile in 10:09. It wasn’t quite 10 minutes, but I did it.

I proudly knocked on my brother’s door with a smile plastered on my face. The ten-dollar bill he reluctantly handed over was priceless. My smile remained as I stuffed the creased bill into my wallet and vowed never to use it—a lucky charm, if you will. I closed the once empty wallet, with newfound confidence I never had before. Over the course of a few months, I improved tremendously. Whether it takes a week, a month—a year even—if I set a goal and I run towards it every day, I can reach it.
