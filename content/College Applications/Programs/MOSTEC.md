“Shrimp fried rice!” my mom yelled after taking a customer’s order. My dad barked orders to chefs as woks rolled and danced with the dragon’s breath. My parents immigrated in hopes of a better future for my brother and me. From the moment they arrived in the US, they toiled day till night, from harsh cold winters to sizzling hot summers. I occasionally helped out, but my parents usually shielded me from work, giving me books to read instead. If I didn’t understand something, my dad tried his best to read it and tell me what it meant with the little English he knew. I loved it when he read Cat in the Hat. Through our small reading sessions together, my parents taught me that education is the pathway to success, and it has become a belief of mine.  
  
My parents went to great lengths to make sure my brother and I were happy. Whenever we wanted something, whether it was food or a small toy, they never said no. When I asked my parents for a laptop, they bought one with the little money they had. My Fujitsu Lifebook LH531 became the catalyst for my love of technology. I wanted to know how everything worked, how I could go on the internet, how websites were designed, how my favorite Flash games were made.  
  
I want to go to college to learn as much as I can and apply that knowledge to become successful. I want to repay them for the laptop that kept me up all night, the delicious food I ate, the nerf guns I wanted. I want to make sure that they don’t have to work when they are older and provide for them as they had done for me.

**What are you passionate about? How have you spent time developing this passion?**

It was finally winter break. I reclined back and stretched my arms out. No schoolwork, no obligations, nothing. In front of me was the Arduino kit I got for Christmas. Since I started coding, I've only made small programs. COVID-19 put robotics to a halt. The gift was my first opportunity to create a physical project. There were many projects I could make: a macro keypad for quick shortcuts; a vacuum attached to a car to clean my room without ever getting up. Suddenly, something completely unrelated popped into my mind. Pollyanna was coming up in three days!  
  
I scrambled to get back up and started brainstorming what to get. Aha! I reached over to my keyboard and typed in nike.com, searching for Black Air Force 1s. He's a size 9, right? My heart rate steadily decreased when I hit purchase.  
  
January 3, 2022. I was convinced it was a mistake, but the string of text remained unchanged. My heart rate increased again as I frantically scanned my room until my eyes settled back on the Arduino.  
  
I raced downstairs and snatched my mom's old Nike shoe box while begging her to take me to MicroCenter. Searching up and down the aisles, I eventually found everything I needed: an SD Card Shield, a small speaker, and a pack of photoresistors. When I got home, I sacrificed my camera's SD Card, downloading Ryte Night by NBA Youngboy on it—an inside joke amongst my friends after Spotify unexpectedly blasted it while hanging out.  
  
I taped my janky masterpiece on the shoe box and topped it off with a printed photo of the crispy shoes. The laughter that erupted after he opened the shoebox affirmed my love for technology—specifically creating things.

**What do you hope to gain from participating in the MITES or MOSTEC program? If selected, how would you contribute to the MITES or MOSTEC communities?**

The students who attend MOSTEC are interested in STEM with a thirst for knowledge. I wish to join this community to create new bonds that will last beyond the program with people who share a similar interest as me. The learning community that MOSTEC fosters will challenge us academically, and, if I ever need help, I know that I can rely on my newfound friends and the teaching staff who want to see us succeed.  
  
If I attend MOSTEC, I will be able to take rigorous courses to learn more about STEM and gain experience managing my time during the academic phase. I will take advantage of the enrichment phase to help me get prepared for the college selection process.  
Personally, I am excited to learn what my peers are interested in and the types of projects we will be making, sharing them with each other virtually.  
  
I will be able to contribute a philomathic attitude, learning as much as I can in the amount of time I will be a part of the program. I will also contribute to my peers by helping with anything they don’t understand just as they would for me, building a community where everyone helps each other when we learn and laughs when we are working together or having fun.

**Tell us of a time you experienced a significant challenge in your life. What did you do and what did you learn?**

The aqua autumn sea breeze futilely cooled me down from the scorching sun taunting me. Every time my foot struck concrete, the dagger dug and twisted deeper into my abdomen; the side stitches were unbearable. The searing pain in my shins grew more excruciating, their cries for me to stop getting louder. But I couldn’t. My breathing became heavy. I gasped for air but absorbed little. I lost my pride that day—and five dollars.  
  
Isolated in my tiny room for a year and a half, I longed to go outside. I made a pact to stay active once quarantine was over by running.  
  
I Googled the average mile time: nine to ten minutes. I scoffed. Easy. I was so confident that I opened my wallet and bet my brother all the money inside.  
  
  
0.7 miles. It seemed impossible. I'm going further tomorrow.  
  
0.7 miles—again. I'm going further tomorrow.  
  
0.8 miles. I'm going further tomorrow.  
  
Kelly Drive became my new home after school. Each day, I inched closer to a mile, and when I reached that, closer to a ten-minute mile.  
  
  
The sun was kind, glistening on the Schuylkill River. I had a metallic taste in my throat. A few minutes ago, I saw people at Lloyd Hall with their organic salads from the Cosmic Café as old ladies and short fifth-graders outpaced men, but it no longer mattered. In the distance, the angels on the statue played their music as Spotify shuffled to Drake's "God's Plan." The final sprint. I expended all the energy I had left. My arms flailed, my feet about to explode. Victory buzzed in my pocket—1 mile in 10:28. It wasn't a 10-minute mile, but it provided me with tangible evidence that, if I tried hard enough, I could reach anything I set my mind to.

**The STEM field uses science, technology, engineering and/or math to understand more about the world around us and to solve problems. If you could develop, invent, or innovate anything to change the world for the better using STEM, what would it be and why?**

Since I got into middle school, my parents have been driving the thirty—close to forty—minute drive every school day. Sometimes, when traffic is extremely bad, it gets close to an hour. Why? So I don’t need to take the hour bus and train ride. They want to make sure I get enough sleep every night, so the time it takes for them to drive me is worth it for them. But what if things didn’t need to be this way? What if public transportation was more robust and reliable? What if traffic on I-95 didn’t get so bad every day? What if I could drive to school myself? These were a few questions I pondered one September morning going to school when it was faster to go through New Jersey to my school than it was to stay on the highway.  
  
I once watched a video on the solution to traffic by CGP Gray. If every car was controlled by AI, it would eliminate the room for human error, removing traffic. If we made the switch, red lights would be rendered useless. AI would allow cars to communicate in an instant, creating free-flowing traffic. It was a great idea: my parents would no longer need to drive me and would eliminate the seemingly endless traffic that day.  
  
Self-driving capabilities could also be carried over to public transportation, creating a transportation system where buses and trains are always on time. It would also make accidents less frequent, by being able to detect when a person is on the tracks and stopping the train in an instant. I hope to be able to understand more about AI to eventually contribute to a safer, greener, more efficient future where kids don’t have to worry about being late about getting to school on time.

**OPTIONAL - If you could meet us in person, what would you share with us about you that isn’t already in the application?**

I'm shy. I've tried several things to change that, like playing a novice rendition of Fur Elise for students during my elementary school's talent show, giving a speech to run for school treasurer during middle school, and joining the debate team for my school when I was in middle school and 10th grade. Over time, I have gotten better at expressing myself to other people and sharing my thoughts, but I am still working on it. It is a goal of mine to make more friends and become more social and confident in myself.
