The aqua autumn sea breeze futilely cooled me down from the red scorching sun taunting me. I tried to ignore it, but the sweat glistening on my forehead hinted at my defeat. Every time my foot struck concrete, the sharp dagger dug and twisted deeper and deeper into my abdomen; the side stitches were unbearable. The searing pain in my shins grew more and more excruciating, their cries for me to stop getting louder and louder. But I couldn’t. My goal was just within reach. My breathing became heavy, gasping for air. I came to a sudden halt. I lost my pride that day—and five dollars. 

While isolated in my tiny room for a year and a half, I caught myself glancing out the window, noticing how colorful it was, picturing myself basking in the smiling summer sun while the refreshing winds made their best attempt to steal my hair. I didn’t go out often and wasn’t the most active; I was always the first to drop out of the pacer test, exhausted and out of breath before it even began. I made a pact with myself to change that. I can be the last one running.

An average person runs a nine to ten minute mile. I scoffed. Easy. It didn’t seem that difficult. I was so confident that I opened my wallet and bet my brother all the money I had—a five-dollar bill.

0.7 miles. I bent over, my hands on my knees. Suddenly, a blond-haired kid, maybe four feet and a half, came barreling down, barely crashing into me, and sprinted off into the distance like a lion chasing its prey. It looked effortless to him, continuing on without breaking a sweat. There’s no way a fifth-grader is going to beat me. I ran after him, but the side stitches flared up, silencing all my thoughts. I slowed down to a walking pace until my phone buzzed—I had reached a mile. A slate stone statue of three angels flying, playing music. I set a mental marker; I’m getting here tomorrow.

0.7 miles—again. I’m going further tomorrow.

0.8 miles. I’m going further tomorrow.

0.8 miles—again. I’m going further tomorrow.

For an entire month, Kelly Drive became my new home after school. Each day, I inched closer to a mile, and when I reached that, closer to a ten-minute mile. 

  

The sea breeze is friendly. The sun is kind, glistening on the Schuylkill River. I have a metallic taste in my throat, but my goal is within reach. In the distance, the angels play their music as Spotify shuffles to Drake’s “God’s Plan.” 0.9 miles at a pace of 10:30 per mile. Gone were the thoughts of controlled breathing, in through my nose, and out through my mouth. Gone were the thoughts of how my foot should strike the ground. 

Victory buzzes from my phone—1 mile in 10:28. It wasn’t quite 10 minutes, but I did it.

I proudly knocked on my brother’s door with a sweeping smile plastered on my face. The five-dollar bill he reluctantly handed back was priceless. It gave tangible evidence of the work and effort I had put in. Over the course of a few months, I improved tremendously. I went from nearly collapsing not even a mile in, to running a mile, to running a mile at an almost-average time. Whether it takes a week, a month—a year even—if I set a goal and I actively work towards it every day, I can reach it. My smile remained as I stuffed the creased bill back into my wallet and vowed never to use it—a lucky charm if you will. I closed the once empty wallet, and a new goal emerged. I will run the Philadelphia Marathon.
