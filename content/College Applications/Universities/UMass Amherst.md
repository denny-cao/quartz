**Please tell us why you want to attend UMass Amherst?***

When I witnessed a quite terrifying bipedal robot that looked like the legs of a kangaroo—Cassie—walk around during my GRASP Lab internship, I wanted to understand the unfamiliar yet exciting world of robotics. At UMass Amherst, through the Dynamic and Autonomous Robotic Systems Lab, I can research how Cassie's—and other robots'—locomotion can be improved to create my dream; robots working alongside humans.

Aside from some of the most inspirational and brilliant professors and students in the world being at UMass Amherst, I look forward to seeing if the hype friends have built up for the dining halls hold merit!

Dull, dangerous, dirty. My parents work long hours in summer heat at the restaurant. Garbage collectors have to deal with entire neighborhoods’ trash. Factory laborers work in dirty and dangerous conditions, forced to mindlessly complete tasks quickly to keep up production. To make a living, many are forced to take jobs roboticists describe as the 3Ds. I want to study CS to be a part of the rapid improvement of AI and robotics to create a future where workers have more free time to see friends and family, take care of their parents and children, and pursue their true passions.
