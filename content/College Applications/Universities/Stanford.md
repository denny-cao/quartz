Kids constantly ask "Why?", yet stop as they grow older. The education system encourages students to memorize rather than understand; many students I’ve tutored opt to memorize to pass a test. Innovation and discovery spurs from questions. We must foster an environment that encourages curiosity—encourages asking "Why?"

**What is the most significant challenge that society faces today? (50 words)**

Scientists don't represent minorities in datasets, resulting in technologies like facial detection that are less effective for Black people and women. Medical textbooks contain only photos of white people, causing misdiagnoses for many racial minorities. We must acknowledge these implicit biases and work to make the future more equitable.

**Briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities, a job you hold, or responsibilities you have for your family.  (50 words)**
As young designers, while redesigning Philadelphia Trail Club's website, we opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities, obfuscating information. We forgot the target audience—senior citizens. Talking with members has reminded me of the value of diverse opinions, as they provide unique perspectives that are often overlooked.

**How did you spend your last two summers? (50 words)**
2021: Attempted mile run, lost $5; learned HTML/CSS/JS through CodedbyKids Summer; tutored for UPchieve; worked as a cashier

2022: Mile run PR (6:41!); tried Chiptole for the first time; created robot guide dog Roselle and wrote about the future of robotics at MOSTEC; researched extrinsic contact estimation at GRASP Lab

**Name one thing you are looking forward to experiencing at Stanford.  (50 words)**
The annual Dish Runs. As I pound the pavement with friends, struggling to run up and down the hills, I'll be feeling the wind of freedom blowing through my hair and soaking up all the beauty of Stanford. I can't wait to measure my progress over the next four years!

**Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus.  Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate - and us - get to know you better.  (250 words)**
Hey Roomie!  

“Siĕh lō̤ muôi?“—”Have you eaten yet?”

In the third grade, I asked my grandma why we say this greeting when we meet others. She told of a past when there was little to eat. Neighbors would ask this question and share food, even if they themselves were hungry. Because of this, food has become ingrained into our culture, so much so that food has become our “love language.”  

I’d like to extend this to you. If you’re ever hungry, I’ll happily make you my world-renowned burnt scrambled eggs (cooking ability definitely isn’t hereditary)—or just grab you something to eat from Wilbur.

Food allows us to learn about each other and explore new flavors and traditions. All my life, I’ve been surrounded by Chinese food (I had Chipotle for the first time last summer). I look forward to trying new things, learning about the foods you grew up with, and sharing the fish balls, peanut butter noodles, and wonton I grew up with.

As we embark on our journey at Stanford—and our culinary adventure—together, let's create a new recipe that blends our interests and leave it behind in the Class of 2027 time capsule. Sure, we might have a few cooking failures along the way, but that's all part of the fun. We can laugh about our mishaps and celebrate our successes together. Who knows, maybe we'll even come up with something that's actually edible!

So roommate, have you eaten yet?

**The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom.  Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning. (250 words)**

When I witnessed a quite terrifying bipedal robot that looked like the legs of a kangaroo—Cassie—walk around during my GRASP Lab internship, I wanted to understand the unfamiliar yet exciting world I entered. _What's a mass-spring-damper system? How do force-torque sensors work? Will robots be our future overlords?_ Each time, my questions would remain unanswered after endlessly scrolling through Google, attempting to absorb pages of esoteric terms and complex explanations. Each time, my questions were stashed away in little sticky notes.

During lunch and TGIF dinners, Adam and Alp shared problems they faced getting the Franka to roll a ball in a circle. Junyao marveled at the pace of AI research, sharing how Google built another model, Parti, to convert text into images nearly a month after their Imagen model. Often, I was confused. However, they encouraged me to ask questions.

I also set up an interview with Professor Dinesh Jayaraman to discuss his work on the perception-action loop of learning for robots. I learned about the similarities between robot and human learning, Held and Hein’s kitten carousel experiment, the ethical implications of robotics. At home, I tried to understand David Silver’s reinforcement learning lectures and ask any questions to lab mates.

Week by week, I saw the power of asking questions. Each question sparked fruitful discussion, leading to better understanding and new ideas. I’ve become more excited about learning knowing that its normal to be confused—knowing that I no longer need to keep my questions as sticky notes.


**Tell us something that is meaningful to you and why.  (250 words)**
Photography gives me an outlet to share stories. With each release of the shutter, a story is eternalized.  

In the harsh cold of winter, a woman exits the shadows cast by the tall buildings on Market Street and walks into a puddle of light emitted by the golden sun, creating a story of hope.

With a low shutter speed, the people around an embracing couple blur, creating movement while the couple remains still. Inn that moment, nothing matters to the couple besides themselves and finally reuniting.  

Even more enjoyable than the finished story is the process. Roaming the streets of Philadelphia with my camera is euphoric. I’m constantly reminded how large the city is, always finding something new to photograph. Even in the same location, there are millions of ways to take a photo by simply changing my perspective or trying new techniques.  

I’m not scurrying to get anywhere; I can slow down, observe the world around me, listen to the sounds of the city. By absorbing the environment, I notice things I normally wouldn’t see: the intricate designs on a wall to use as leading lines; the heart carved into a tree at the park; the reflection of the Benjamin Franklin bridge on the window.

As I flip through my photo albums, I relive each moment I documented, recalling the feelings I felt, like the laughter during a cookout we had for my friend’s birthday. Most memories fade away, but through photography, I can preserve some of the best.
