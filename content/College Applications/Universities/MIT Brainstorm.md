# Background
##### Please tell us more about your cultural background and identity in the space below. (optional; 150 words or fewer)
“Siĕh lō̤ muôi?”—“Have you eaten yet?” in Fuzhounese—is synonymous to “How are you?”  

As hunger becomes a less prevalent issue, the phrase is being phased out of the vocabulary of speakers. However, this principle of loving others and overcoming struggles together is still ingrained in our culture.

"Siĕh lō̤ muôi?"—"Have you eaten yet?" in Fuzhounese—is used as a greeting, sort of like "How are you?" It seems like a weird greeting, but there is a lot of cultural history embedded in the simple phrase.

When my grandparents were young, hunger was prevalent in China. Some months, there would be a lot of food. Some months, there would be droughts or floods, ruining crops. Chinese people often asked each other "have you eaten yet?" to ask if they needed food; they were willing to take care of others, even if they themselves had little.

As hunger becomes less of an issue, the phrase is slowly being phased out by the newer generation. However, expressing love through food and caring for others is still very much ingrained in our culture.

	- Accessible apps, robots that help, etc.
	- Website to be accessible

- Poverty widespread in Philadelphia
- Climate change is pressing issue, electric vehicles

- Immigrant family working hard every day… They just wanted me to be able to provide for myself in the future


Technology is being placed in the hands of people relatively young now---my dad bought me a laptop in kindergarten. However, as technology has become more accessible, there seems to be a group of people that are alienated from it. My parents are not the most tech-savy people in the world. I've been helping them fdsafsfds fdasfdsafdas fdafdsafdasfdsa.

To make the world a better place with STEM, we must realize that it is becoming extremely esoteric, with many being alienated from it because of their age. 
- Digital exclusion
- Disabilities
- Society -> Tech; these people are locked out

Story about my grandmother using her phone for the first time

"Open it!" my dad eagered on. It was *nai nai*'s 60th birthday—my grandmother. Her hands slowly unwrapped our present as we waited in anticipation. She lifted the cover, revealing the latest iPhone—the 6s Max. Her face lit up with joy; for as long as I could remember, she had been using her old Blackberry flip phone. 

The next few months, I became her personal tech support. 

"How do I get WeChat?"
"How do I rotate my screen?"

I began to realize the importance of technology, and how it can ease the lives of people of all ages. I had the ability to play Minecraft with friends from school at 11:00 at night on school days, but technology also gave me the power to have my questions answered in seconds with a simple Google query. My grandmother no longer needed to pay for prepaid cards to call her friends; she could now use WeChat to contact friends and family members. She could now use the internet to find new recipes to cook whenever I came over to help her xyz. Over time, more innovations came, from prosthetics, to robots that would remove my chore of sweeping and mopping the house (and *mama* telling me I forgot to clean somewhere!) 

- Honestly could pivot to a story where my parents tell me to mop the floor. I mop it. We go to Target. I see Roomba. Its expensive. Technology not only will ease our lives, but make it accessible to everyone. 
	- Aligns with my research 

The next few months, I would go over to help her with technology issues. "How do I get WeChat?" "fdsafdas?" 

Despite how difficult it was for her to learn how to use her phone, I saw how it made her life better. She could connect with her friends back in China, look at current events, and find new recipes to cook whenever I came over. 

I realized the importance of technology, and how it can ease the lives of people. However, there was a barrier to entry. As technology has become more accessible, there seems to be a group of people that are alienated from it. To truly make the world a better place with technology, we must recognize the esoteric nature of STEM and aim to make it more accessible for everyone.

"*baba*, why are you always working?" I naively asked one morning before third grade. 

"To make money," he replied, picking me up from the ground to hug me.

"Why do we need money?" I inquired. 

"So you and your brother can grow **something about giving a future to us?**" he said, kissing my forehead. He put me back down and left for work with *mama*.

All my life, my parents have been working long hours to provide for me and my brother. 

- could talk about iron man and how he saved the world with engineering basically
- I wanted to do more; I wanted to be Iron Man. 
- story about restaurant but mend it; i ask him why he does it.
- he wants me to just grow up to not do that and becom elike a 9-5 worker
- thats not me tho. i watched iron man :)
- iron man poster in my room

- Used it for WeChat to connect with people from China---Made world better, but there was a barrier before then. I had to teach her to use technology
- Same happens for my parents; paperless billing has made life easier, but at what cost? 
- Commentary on how technology is extremely esoteric. My goal is MIT's mission of making the world a better place with STEM, but not forgetting to make it accessible to everyone; if not, it only benefits a select few.

“Shrimp fried rice!” my mom yelled after taking a customer’s order. My dad barked orders to chefs as woks rolled and danced with the dragon’s breath. My parents immigrated in hopes of a better future for my brother and me. From the moment they arrived in the US, they toiled day till night, from harsh cold winters to sizzling hot summers. I occasionally helped out, but my parents usually shielded me from work, giving me books to read instead. If I didn’t understand something, my dad tried his best to read it and tell me what it meant with the little English he knew. I loved it when he read Cat in the Hat. Through our small reading sessions together, my parents taught me that education is the pathway to success, and it has become a belief of mine. 

My parents went to great lengths to make sure my brother and I were happy. Whenever we wanted something, whether it was food or a small toy, they never said no. When I asked my parents for a laptop, they bought one with the little money they had. My Fujitsu Lifebook LH531 became the catalyst for my love of technology. I wanted to know how everything worked, how I could go on the internet, how websites were designed, how my favorite Flash games were made. 

I want to go to college to learn as much as I can and apply that knowledge to become successful. I want to repay them for the laptop that kept me up all night, the delicious food I ate, the nerf guns I wanted. I want to make sure that they don’t have to work when they are older and provide for them as they had done for me.

"So you and your brother can grow **something about giving a future to us?**" he said, kissing my forehead. He put me back down and left for work with *mama*.

My parents resolved to provide for me so I could grow up and not end up like them. They didn't wish that I would become incredibly successful--having a decent job to provide for my family was enough for them. 

On a rare off-day, my parents took me to the library to get books. I wounded up in the DVD section and came across the *Iron Man* movie. Reluctantly, they agreed to borrow it and watch it with me. I was instantly hooked, watching Tony Stark build the Mark I by himself, and saving others. 

Why do I work so hard? With the Iron Man poster hanging in my bedroom, I knew I would not settle for doing alright in life--I would work as hard as my parents, tinkering with technology and dedicating myself to helping others.

"*Mama*, can I get that?" I pleaded, my finger uncontrollably pointing at the robot toy that looked like the Nao robot.

"No," she sighed. As a child, I was unfamiliar with the concept of money. I didn't know why my parents toiled from day till night at our restaurant, Xin Xing House. I didn't know the struggles they went through, arriving at an unfamiliar country and having to take care of me and my brother. At the time, I only understood that the restaurant was taking away from play time with *mama* and *baba*. 

I reluctantly walked out of Walmart, dragging my feet along while pouting. A month later, I woke up to a knock-off Nao robot on my bedside. I quickly jumped up, racing to my parents’ room to thank them. I was met with an empty room; they had already gone to work. I played by myself, listening to Robo—its new name—sing "beep boop!" As much as I fell in love with Robo, I wished my parents were there.


Robo sparked a desire to learn more about how robots work. Later, through my internship at GRASP Lab, I learned about the future of robotics and the current endeavors and challenges. I want to study and work with robots to create a world where people no longer need to work as hard, a world where parents can spend time with their kids playing with things that go “beep boop!”


# Field of Study
##### Pick what field of study at MIT appeals to you the most right now, and tell us more about why this field of study appeals to you. (100 words or fewer)
Robotics has seen rapid growth over the years with developments in computing power and AI technology. Studying EECS will let me explore an exciting field with new innovations every day at a school built on *mens et manus*, focusing not just on pursuing knowledge, but applying it as well. This is showcased in a course I want to take, 2.007, with the annual robot competition.

Through UROPs, I can work with Alberto Rodriguez, who tackled the same issue of extrinsic contact sensing as I did during my internship.

After a long day of work, my dad surprised me with a new laptop—a Fujitsu Lifebook LH531. The books on the rudimentary desk setup—an empty pail of Kikkoman soy sauce for a chair and a large white freezer for a desk—were replaced with pdf files on my laptop. At night, I would secretly play Minecraft under my blanket. 

My laptop quickly became my best friend, keeping me company when my parents were working. There was so much I could do with a small--now considered thick-- device. I could watch John Cena 

I silently shut the door behind me as a smile began to form on my face. Screwdriver in hand, I quickly went to work, taking apart my laptop one screw at a time. I popped the backplate off, unveiling the sorcery that had let me play Minecraft with friends at night when I was supposed to be sleeping. It felt invigorating, like I was exploring a deep cave rife with unknowns.

As a kid, I always wondered how my robot toys made "Beep! Boop!" noises. Growing up, I saw how robots not only gave me something to

# For Fun
##### We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you do simply for the pleasure of it. (225 words or fewer)
- Running
- Me running
- https://therunningclinic.com/runners/blog/archives-anglaises/is-running-actually-for-people-who-are-masochistic/
	- I used to not like it… It felt masochistic; inflicting pain on myself… gasping for air… breathing heavily… feet in pain… shins dying
	- intentionally putting myself in pain and discomfort

- Reflection: Running reminds me about life. If I don’t go out and run today, I did everything for nothing. If I keep making excuses. Oh it’s raining. So if it rains tomorrow, I don’t go run again? And the day after? And the day after that? Oh it’s too hot… So I don’t run during the summer?
- Reminder importance of perseverance 

During quarantine, I caught myself glancing out the window, noticing how colorful it was, picturing myself basking in the smiling summer sun while the refreshing winds made their best attempt to steal my hair. I didn't go out often and wasn't the most active. I made a pact with myself to change that. 

That vow led me to fall in love with running. I began appreciating nature and being outside. Running is a way for me to let go—to let the rhythmic beat of my steps drown out my worries and thoughts. Whenever I’m stressed, I go out and run, taking in my surroundings and forgetting about everything else. I love the feeling of the wind brushing against my skin, pulling my hair back. I loved the sound of the wind whistling in my ear and the rustling of the trees as their leaves slowly drift to the ground.

The last autumn leaf had fallen, leaving all the trees around me barren; winter was approaching. The wind playfully tickled my ear as it picked up various shades of red, orange, and yellow, playfully tossing them around. 

My footsteps match the beat of Spring Thief by Yorushika. Left. Right. Annie, the old lady I occasionally see sitting on the bench waves to me. To my left, the Schuylkill river glistens from the sun, smiling directly above.

Endless lines of code lay in front of me--the fruits of my week of labor. It was finally complete. Switching over to my terminal. The script would run the simulator, with the Franka Panda arm following a contact policy, collecting data with the objects that randomly spawned in. I pressed the enter key, and was greeted by a wall of red error text.

*No worries. I can debug this.* I leaned back on my chair and cracked my knuckles, anticipating the long day ahead of me. 

Tick. Tock. Hours passed, and it was quickly approaching the end of my work day (what word do I use here? Its not a shift its a...). I shook my head. I'll stay an extra hour. 

Tick. Tock. I ran the script, and a completely different error filled the terminal. My stomach dropped. I couldn't figure it out. *Maybe I can tomorrow*.
