**The core purpose of The University of Texas at Austin is, "To Transform Lives for the Benefit of Society." Please share how you believe your experience at UT-Austin will prepare you to “Change the World” after you graduate.**

To survive, many are forced to take jobs roboticists describe as the three D's: dull, dangerous, dirty. Factory workers work in dirty and dangerous conditions, forced to mindlessly complete tasks quickly to keep up production. Garbage collectors have to deal with entire neighborhoods’ trash. My parents toil endlessly—day till night—to take care of my brother and me. I envision a future where workers have more free time to see friends and family, take care of their parents and children, and pursue their true passions. Robotics will lead us there.

UT-Austin recently narrowed its CS program to various concentrations. This makes the broad field that is computer science and makes it smaller, focusing on what I'm interested in learning. I will concentrate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, as in order to create the future I imagine, robots must become smarter and more adaptable to different scenarios. The school will also be providing a dedicated Robotics Minor in Spring 2023, which I'm exciting to learning more about!

Immediately in my freshman year, I can work to create the future through the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI), researching autonomous robots with Professor Stone to bring autonomous machines to the Gates complex and eventually expand to the world.

At UT-Austin, I will be part of a collaborative environment where new ideas are welcome. I can participate in the annual HackTX—one of the largest student run hackathons in Texas—and meet new people, sharing different ideas and innovations, taking risks to create the best hack. Maybe one of these ideas becomes something that will change the world! 

Change needs to start somewhere, no matter how humble of a start it is. UT-Austin provides both the rigorous education and abundance of resources that will help me take the first step.

**Describe how your experiences, perspectives, talents, and/or your involvement in leadership activities (at your school, job, community, or within your family) will help you to make an impact both in and out of the classroom while enrolled at UT.**

In elementary school, I repurposed my Sketchers shoe box as my “question box.” If I couldn’t figure something out in class, I would write down my question on a piece of paper and drop it in the box. Occasionally, I would dig in, pick a random question, and attempt to understand it. 

I had always been afraid to ask for help because I feared being wrong, afraid of what others thought about me. Each question I kept to myself was another concept I didn’t understand and time spent trying to do so. In middle school, I resolved to change, beginning my war against my low self confidence. When it was announced that we could run for school treasurer, I penned my name on the form. It was the perfect opportunity; we had to speak in front of the school. The laughter that erupted from my jokes while speaking about selling sparklers to fund Yu-Gi-Oh card packs encouraged me to continue fighting.

The war continued in high school. I talked to people that sat next to me in classes and made friends outside of school. I began to raise my hand more in class, but was still afraid of being wrong and asking questions.

During my internship, there were many things I didn't understand. I didn’t know what a mass-spring-damper system was. I didn’t know how force-torque sensors worked. Each time, I would write a new sticky note. Each time, my questions would remain unanswered, as I still failed to understand after Googling. 

On Wednesdays, I sat in on meetings where lab members would share their progress on their research, and others would ask questions. The presenter would answer, increasing the understanding of the listeners, and the presenter would consider factors and methods proposed by others. Week by week, I saw the power of asking questions—even “bad” questions. Each question sparked fruitful discussion and collaboration, leading to better understanding and new ideas.

Asking questions is beneficial for both parties. I look forward to staying inquisitive at UT, refraining from keeping my questions as another sticky note.



BEEP! The red Honda angrily screams behind the 42 bus, rudely interrupting Beyoncé singing in my earbuds. A cloud of smoke from the exhaust blows behind us. The bus does not move an inch despite the light turning green, sitting still along with the rest of traffic, bumper to bumper. A tall, navy-suited man impatiently taps his loafers on the floor, glancing at his watch every few minutes. A lady calls her friend, apologizing that she will be late.

After riding public transportation my entire life, I have become jaded to traffic, factoring in an extra 10-15 minutes for any planned trips. So much time is wasted from sitting around, shifting a few inches every few minutes until reaching a destination, along with extra fuel consumption, causing more pollution.

With technology rapidly advancing, we are fully ready for a change. Strangely, traffic lights have made little innovation since their conception in the 1920s. By detecting traffic density, an autonomous algorithm can easily determine the most efficient lights to display, decreasing congestion. With AI and the Internet-of-Things, why can’t Philadelphia and other overcrowded cities adopt smart traffic lights? I would like to study computer science be a part of this revolution, using AI to solve solve many  issues in society. People’s lives can be made easier with robotics. Medicinal trials can be sped up with computing. Self-driving cars cut down accidents, pollution, and traffic.
  
I finally arrive at my stop, fifteen minutes after I’d planned. I dream of a future where technology can create a safer, greener, more efficient future where people don’t have to worry about being late.

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania to research robotic manipulation and perception with Leon Kim, a graduate student. Within the first few weeks, I began to see how much I didn’t know. During lunch and TGIF dinners, I listened as lab members discussed their research and recent developments. Adam and Alp explained problems they were facing trying to get the Franka Panda—a robotic arm—to roll a ball around in a circle. Junyao marveled at the pace of AI research, sharing how Google built another model, Parti, to convert text into images nearly a month after their Imagen model. I would come across esoteric words, acronyms, and concepts that were foreign to me. They would notice how I was confused, and would stop to ask what I was confused about. They encouraged me to be inquisitive, and I became more comfortable asking questions and asking for help.

Their knowledge was beneficial while I worked on my MOSTEC projects. For my robotics course, I asked Leon and other students for input on my robot guide dog, Roselle. They helped me improve my CAD, and got a few ideas of how to implement navigation. I opted to create an Android application and use a Bluetooth module to connect to the phone and receive instructions. This project proved to be too complex for the short amount of time we had, so I’ve been continuing to work on it during my free time. I’m working on implementing voice recognition to query OpenStreetMap for a route to the destination. 

During summer break, my friends and I worked to redesign the website of Philadelphia Trail Club, a non-profit hiking club for senior citizens. When we presented it to the senior board members, we were told that it was too confusing. As young, eager designers, we had opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities, which obfuscated information. To make the best website, we needed to collaborate with the club. 

Initially, we thought it would be best to keep the homepage extremely minimal, separating all the information into different pages. However, the board members wanted the majority of the information on the homepage so older people wouldn’t have to navigate through different pages. Balance was needed, so I asked members what they thought was most important. We placed the club’s mission, events calendar, and how to join on the homepage and moved everything else to different pages.

For the navigation menu, I asked a few members if we should keep the hamburger menu, or switch to a more standard horizontal navigation menu. They vouched for the latter; some didn’t even know that clicking the hamburger would open the menu!

Wonderful design isn’t just how the website looks; it is also user-friendliness, a lesson learned from our first trial. As we continue working on the website, we are constantly reminded of the value of diverse opinions, as they provide a different perspective that is often overlooked.

My internships and projects have further shown me the power of computer science. Websites and the internet can be used to bring together groups of people. Robots, and more generally AI, can make people’s lives easier. There is so much to CS, and I aim to learn as much as I can so I can contribute to the field of computer science—the future.
