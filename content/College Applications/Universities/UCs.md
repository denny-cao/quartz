**Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.**


For someone who even struggles to draw the simplest of stick figures and cannot for their life play the violin in tune, photography gives me an outlet to share stories. With each release of the shutter, a story is eternalized in the form of an image. These stories can be of anything—even the most mundane. 

A woman crosses a busy street.
*Click!* 

A soldier exits a taxi and warmly embraces his wife.
*Click!*

In the harsh cold of winter, the woman exits the shadows cast by the tall buildings on Market Street and walks into a puddle of light emitted by the golden sun, creating a story of hope.

With a low shutter speed, the people around the couple become blurred, creating movement as they go about their day while the couple remains still. It tells a story of how, in that moment, nothing mattered to the couple besides themselves and finally reuniting. 

Even more enjoyable than the finished story is the process. Roaming the streets of Philadelphia with my camera is euphoric, manually adjusting aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. I’m constantly reminded how large the city is, always finding something new to photograph. Even in the same location, there are millions of ways to take a photo by simply changing my perspective or trying new techniques, like shooting reflections.

Since I’m not scurrying to get somewhere; instead, I can finally slow down, observe the world around me, listen to the sounds of the city. By absorbing in the environment, I notice things I normally wouldn’t see to act as framing devices or subjects: the intricate designs on a wall to use as leading lines; the heart carved into a tree at the park; the reflection of the Benjamin Franklin bridge on the window. 

As I flip through my photo albums, I relive each moment I documented, recalling both the event and the feelings I felt, like the laughter during a cook out we had for my friend’s birthday and burning hot dogs. Memories will always fade away, but through photography, I can at least preserve some of the best.

Photography is a creative medium that allows me to not only share a specific moment in time, but also the emotions I felt through composition, light, and color. It lets me tell stories.





I looked up—the crosswalk light had turned red and she was gone. The clouds slowly covered the sun—the light had disappeared.

Beep Boop! RoBi—my toy robot—chimed. Since I was little, I’ve dreamed about having a robot friend to keep my company while my parents were away working at the restaurant. 

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania to research robotic manipulation and perception with Leon Kim, a graduate student. Within the first few weeks, I began to see how much I didn’t know. During lunch and TGIF dinners, I listened as lab members discussed their research and recent developments. Adam and Alp explained problems they were facing trying to get the Franka Panda—a robotic arm—to roll a ball around in a circle. Junyao marveled at the pace of AI research, sharing how Google built another model, Parti, to convert text into images nearly a month after their Imagen model. I would come across esoteric words, acronyms, and concepts that were foreign to me. They would notice how I was confused, and would stop to ask what I was confused about. They encouraged me to be inquisitive, and I became more comfortable asking questions and asking for help.

Their knowledge was beneficial while I worked on my MOSTEC projects. For my science writing article, I wrote about the future of robotics and what it would mean for the labor force. I asked lab members during lunch what they envisioned for the future. I interviewed Leon Kim's advisor, Dinesh Jayaraman, and learned about the past, present, and future of robotics research. He spoke about his work on the perception-action loop for learning and its implications, both for robotics and society. For my robotics course, I asked Leon and other students for input on my robot guide dog, Roselle. They helped me improve my CAD, and got a few ideas of how to implement navigation.

It still feels like a fever dream, having the opportunity to see the Cassie robot walk, controlling the Franka Panda, and working to further the field of robotics. Spending the summer surrounded by passionate and brilliant people has led to a better understanding of robotics and how much there is still to learn!

In elementary school, I repurposed my Sketchers shoe box as my “question box.” If I couldn’t figure something out in class, I would write down my question on a piece of paper and drop it in the box. Occasionally, I would dig in, pick a random question, and attempt to understand it. 

I had always been afraid to ask for help because I feared being wrong, afraid of what others thought about me. Each question I kept to myself was another concept I didn’t understand and time spent trying to do so. In middle school, I resolved to change, beginning my war against my low self confidence. When it was announced that we could run for school treasurer, I penned my name on the form. It was the perfect opportunity; we had to speak in front of the school. The laughter that erupted from my jokes while speaking about selling sparklers to fund Yu-Gi-Oh card packs encouraged me to continue fighting.

The war continued in high school. I talked to people that sat next to me in classes and made friends outside of school. I began to raise my hand more in class, but was still afraid of being wrong and asking questions.

During my internship, there were many things I didn't understand. I didn’t know what a mass-spring-damper system was. I didn’t know how force-torque sensors worked. Each time, I would write a new sticky note. Each time, my questions would remain unanswered, as I still failed to understand after Googling. 

On Wednesdays, I sat in on meetings where lab members would share their progress on their research, and others would ask questions. These questions sparked discussion, where the presenter would explain, increasing the understanding of the listeners, and the presenter would consider factors and methods proposed by others. Week by week, I saw the power of asking questions—even “bad” questions. Questions push me to develop more quickly than if I did everything alone.

Although my question box is still used, it is very seldom. Raising my hand in class drastically reduced the amount of sticky notes I used!


During summer break, my friends and I worked to redesign the website of Philadelphia Trail Club, a non-profit hiking club for senior citizens. When we presented it to the senior board members, we were told that it was too confusing. As young, eager designers, we had opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities, which obfuscated information. To make the best website, we needed to collaborate with the club. 

Initially, we thought it would be best to keep the homepage extremely minimal, separating all the information into different pages. However, the board members wanted the majority of the information on the homepage so older people wouldn’t have to navigate through different pages. Their opinion had merit, but too much information was also an issue. I explained our view, how mountains of text would only make it harder to find information, and they agreed. Balance was needed, so I asked members what they thought was most important. We placed the club’s mission, events calendar, and how to join on the homepage and moved everything else to different pages.

For the navigation menu, I asked a few members if we should keep the hamburger menu, or switch to a more standard horizontal navigation menu. They vouched for the latter; some didn’t even know that clicking the hamburger would open the menu!

Wonderful design isn’t just how the website looks; it is also user-friendliness, a lesson learned from our first trial. As we continue working on the website, we are constantly reminded of the value of diverse opinions, as they provide a different perspective that is often overlooked.
