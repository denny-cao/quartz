In elementary school, I repurposed my Sketchers shoe box as my “question box.” If I couldn’t figure something out in class, I would write down my question on a piece of paper and drop it in the box. Occasionally, I would dig in, pick a random question, and attempt to understand it. Over time, my box has become full, filled with unasked and unanswered questions.

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at UPenn to research robotic manipulation and perception. I saw so many cool things: the Cassie robot walk; a robotic arm controlled through a VR headset; I controlled the Franka Panda arm. Tossed into this unfamiliar yet exciting world, I sought to understand. _What's a mass-spring-damper system? How do force-torque sensors work?_ Each time, my questions remained unanswered after endlessly scrolling through Google, trying to absorb pages of esoteric terms and complex explanations.

During lunch and TGIF dinners, lab members discussed recent developments. Adam and Alp explained problems they were facing trying to get the Franka to roll a ball around in a circle. Junyao shared how Google built Parti, to convert text into images nearly a month after their Imagen model. They would notice how I was confused, and allowed me to ask questions. 

Week by week, I saw the power of questions—even “bad” questions. Each question sparked fruitful discussion and collaboration, leading to better understanding and new ideas. I look forward to staying inquisitive at Duke, refraining from keeping my questions as another sticky note.

Duke, with its liberal arts education, will be a welcoming supplement to my focus in ECE; only by learning and understanding the world can we begin to see its problems and have discussions about what can be done. 

At Duke, I can explore robotics through the Robotics certificate program and apply my knowledge through research. I would like to work with Professor Ron Parr to continue researching robotic perception and manipulation to make my dream of a future where robots can work together with humans a reality.  

The collaborative environment isn’t isolated to research—its present throughout the school. Its a place where I can walk up to any student and ask, “How are you?” Its a place where I can easily get help for p-sets—even late at night. Its a place where faculty want students to succeed. Maybe its because of the beautiful weather. Maybe its because of the beautiful campus. Regardless, it is a place I want to be.

The collaborative nature seeps into its sports. On TV, I’ve watched and listened to the Cameron Crazies’ antics and chants, and I long to be a part of it, a community that carries pride and is united under one name—Duke. I can’t wait to be a K-ville superfan, being with my peers, cheering on the future of Duke basketball as they take on UNC, cheering “not our rivals!”

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania to research robotic control with Leon Kim, a graduate student. Tossed into this unfamiliar yet exciting world, I wanted to desperately wanted to explore more about how everything worked. I didn’t know what a mass-spring-damper system was. I didn’t know how force-torque sensors worked. Each time, I would write a new sticky note. Each time, my questions would remain unanswered after endlessly scrolling through Google, trying to absorb pages of esoteric terms and complex explanations.

During lunch and TGIF dinners, I listened as lab members discussed their research and recent developments. They would notice how I was confused, and allowed me to ask questions—I didn’t need to write sticky notes! I asked about what they envisioned for the future. I interviewed Leon Kim's advisor, Dinesh Jayaraman, and learned about the past, present, and future of robotics research. He spoke about his work on the perception-action loop for learning and its implications, both for robotics and society. With this newfound knowledge, I wrote my MOSTEC article on the implications of robotics for the future.


Week by week, I saw the power of asking questions—even “bad” questions. Each question sparked fruitful discussion and collaboration, leading to better understanding and new ideas. I’ve become more excited about learning knowing that its normal to be confused—knowing that I no longer need to keep my questions as just another sticky note.
