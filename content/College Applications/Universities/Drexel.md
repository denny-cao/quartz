**The late honorable John Lewis was an American statesman and a civil rights leader who devoted his life to racial justice and equality. In June of 2018 he sent this tweet:**

**"Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble."**

**What social justice issue do you want to "make some noise" about and are willing to get into "good trouble, necessary trouble" for, and why? What steps would you take to solve this issue?**

“*xin nian kuai le*!”—Happy Chinese New Year! 

As we made our way to the center of Chinatown, we stumbled upon a large parade, filled with dragon and lion dancers, who were moving to the beat of the drums, accompanied by the loud pops of firecrackers. It was as if the entire neighborhood was alive, pulsing with energy and excitement.

However, over the years, I’ve witnessed the destruction of this cultural center. Despite Asians accounting for roughly 8% of the population and 11% of small business owners in Philadelphia, little has been done to protect and preserve our culture and people.

In the 1930s, construction began for the Vine Street Expressway, disregarding the voices of Asian Americans, effectively dividing Chinatown into two. The effects it has had on the community are still seen today, as it limited the expansion of the community, created congestion in the streets, and created noise pollution. Now, students from Holy Redeemer must cross the high speed intersection to get home or go to the main portion of Chinatown!

Currently, there is a proposition for a 76ers arena on Market Street between 10th and 11th Street. Evident from similar construction projects like the Capital One Area in Washington, DC, these arenas destroy Chinatowns. In Philadelphia, Chinatown is home to thousands of Asians, numerous small businesses, churches, schools, and most importantly, our culture. People would be displaced, businesses would be destroyed, Chinatown would be destroyed.

Just as those before me pushed back against a new Phillies ballpark, I will fight to preserve Chinatown—preserve our culture. To do so, I must use my voice. 

I will use my voice to spread awareness, as despite how many Philadelphians visit Chinatown, little know of the current struggle. I’ve protested along with many other Philadelphia residents to speak out about what the Sixers arena would mean for a place where many seek solidarity. We must send a message that a piece of Philadelphia is under threat and seek the support of others. I will use my voice to echo Martin Niemöller’s warnings of apathy, not speaking out because an issue does not concern someone. 

I will use my voice to educate our political leaders and decision makers about the importance of preserving the Asian-American community and its cultural centers, and find ways to preserve and protect the cultural center while also accommodating development. Two months ago, I sent a mail to my state representative, Jared Solomon, about the preservation of Chinatown—specifically in regards to the Vine Street Expressway. He intends to support the plan to apply for a federal grant through the Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program to fund the project to cap the expressway in order to bring together the community and create more room for expansion. However, I also noted that affordable housing would need to be included in the plan to mitigate the effects of gentrification which he agreed with. 

With our voices united, we will ensure that Chinatown remains a shining symbol of Asian-American culture in Philadelphia and a source of pride for all its residents.zz
