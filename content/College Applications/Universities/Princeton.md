faculty and undergrad interaction. small class sizes, independent work with advisor.

oh shit for penn add a blurb about the program w the high schoolers

###### Please describe why you are interested in studying engineering at Princeton. Include any of your experiences in or exposure to engineering, and how you think the programs offered at the University suit your particular interests. (Please respond in 250 words or fewer.)
To make a living, many are forced into jobs roboticists describe as the three D's: dull, dangerous, and dirty. I’m interested in studying computer science to create a future where my parents don’t need to work long hours in summer heat at the restaurant, a future where robots assist humans.

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at UPenn to research robotic manipulation and perception with Leon Kim, a graduate student. Within the first few weeks, I began to see how much I didn’t know. During lunch and TGIF dinners, I listened as lab members discussed their research. I would come across esoteric words, acronyms, and concepts that were completely foreign. They would notice my confused face and would stop to ask what I didn’t understand, encouraging me to be inquisitive. 

Rooting my exploration of COS in a liberal arts environment will encourage me to continue questioning and find innovative solutions; only by learning and understanding the world can we begin to see its problems and have discussions about what can be done. My journey in liberal arts and STEM immediately begins in my freshman year with the First-year Writing Seminar, where, with a small group, I’ll learn to analyze issues, form cogent arguments for my stance, and have civil discussions about it.

At Princeton, I can pursue the Certificate Program in Robotics and Intelligent Systems to learn about the interdisciplinary nature of robotics, weaving in the life sciences and even philosophy.

Princeton provides research opportunities to connect the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty such as ReMatch. Being a part of a collaborative research environment will allow me to learn more about what must be done to make my dream a reality.

**At Princeton, we value diverse perspectives and the ability to have respectful dialogue about difficult issues. Share a time when you had a conversation with a person or a group of people about a difficult topic. What insight did you gain, and how would you incorporate that knowledge into your thinking in the future?**

rich older white men ppl higher up 
:(
data racist D:

In my science writing course for MOSTEC, we had a discussion about racial and gender bias present in AI. I brought up how emerging technologies such as facial detection worked at a lower rate for darker skin and we discussed deeper about how this wasn’t just in AI—medical professionals are trained with textbooks that have photos of white people, causing them to misdiagnose many African Americans. 

Through our seminar-like discussion, I learned about how deeply rooted racism is in society, and what needs to change. As a student in STEM, I recognized that it was our responsibility to acknowledge our inherent biases and work to create a more equal, more equitable future by ensuring data represents everyone. It also made me realize how the tech industry is dominated by richer, older, white men. We must make an effort to encourage minorities such as people of color and women and provide resources for them to succeed. They will become the role models of the future, showing the next generation that someone that looks like them succeeded—so can they. 

**Princeton has a longstanding commitment to service and civic engagement. Tell us how your story intersects (or will intersect) with these ideals.**
During summer break, my friends and I worked to redesign the website of Philadelphia Trail Club, a non-profit hiking club for senior citizens. When we presented it to the senior board members, we were told that it was too confusing. As young, eager designers, we had opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities, which obfuscated information. 

Immediately, we got to work on simplifying the website, intermittently checking in with some of the members to make sure the website was usable for them. While working with senior citizens, we learned about the technological struggles they had to deal with. STEM, as a constantly developing field, is extremely esoteric in nature. To make the world a better place with technology, everyone must have access to it. Otherwise, the tool meant to help people would be making the world more inequitable. I'm proud to have been able to bridge the gap to using tech through design and plan to continue doing so at Princeton through the Technology for a Just Society (JuST) group. When I enroll in COS333, I can collaborate with others in the group to build software for nonprofit organizations.

At Princeton, I look forward to not just using my skills of technology to bring change, but also being part of an environment where discussion is encouraged to build my courage of using my voice to advocate for what I think is right.

**What is a new skill you would like to learn in college?**
Social skills. Since middle school, I’ve been at a constant fight with my self-confidence. Recently, I’ve gotten more comfortable talking to new people. Princeton’s welcoming community of students and faculty will provide the perfect environment to walk up to someone and ask, “How are you?”

**What brings you joy?** 
Hearing someone I’m tutoring say, “ohhhhhhh, I get it!” Whether its surface integrals or centripetal motion, there's no greater feeling than seeing the moment when something clicks for someone I’m helping, my attempt of finding creative and engaging ways to explain concepts and help people learn being successful.

**What song represents the soundtrack of your life at this moment?**
Dream It Possible by Jane Zhang—I remember first hearing this song play as my friend’s Huawei ringtone The song's upbeat message of chasing dreams serves as a reminder to keep working hard and that failure leads to success. I will continue to fly and not lose sight of my dreams.

- Huawei released a banger
	- Dream big, chase them, because they are possible if you chase, reach, fly until you break. run, climb, soar 
	- not until you fall that you fly: failure is needed. you learn from them. move on. fly on.
	- Huawei; never say failure
	- Huawei ringtone → Friend called, going to pick up, but had to let song play
