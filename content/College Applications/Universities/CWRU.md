**Additional Academic Information**
I received an A- for MATH 1410: Calculus, Part 2 (Multivariable Calculus) at the University of Pennsylvania. I also enrolled in MATH 1700: Ideas in Mathematics for the spring semester.

**Optional short answer: Imagine your future. How will you utilize the resources and opportunities available at Case Western Reserve University to realize that future?**
Dull, dangerous, dirty. My parents work long hours in summer heat at the restaurant. Garbage collectors have to deal with entire neighborhoods’ trash. Factory laborers work in dirty and dangerous conditions, forced to mindlessly complete tasks quickly to keep up production. To make a living, many are forced to take jobs roboticists describe as the 3Ds. I want to study CS to be a part of the rapid improvement of AI and robotics to create a future where workers have more free time to see friends and family, take care of their parents and children, and pursue their true passions.

Case is where I can make the next step towards the future I envision. I’m looking forward to taking EECS 391: Artificial Intelligence with Professor Lewicki Ray. I will also take EECS376: Mobile Robotics with Professor Wyatt Newman. In this class, During my internship at GRASP Lab, I worked extensively with ROS—Robot Operating System—and hope to learn even more in this class about how it can be harnessed to simulate robot actions. Despite how notoriously difficult these courses are, the collaborative environment at Case leads to a place where learning is done together; I won’t struggle on p-sets alone at midnight. Rather, at Case, I can struggle with newfound friends, eventually figuring it out together. Case is a place where professors, faculty, and peers want everyone to succeed.

Outside of classes, I will join the Hacker Society, where I can learn with peers through lectures and discussions how to make a better world with the power that computers provide. I can also participate in the annual hackCWRU hosted by Hacker Society, where I can work with others to bring ideas to life in a short time span. At CWRUbotix, I can work with a team to compete in robot competitions, continuing my exploration of the engineering design process from my high school robotics team. Case is where ideas—even bad ones—are welcomed. 

At Case, I will join the Spartan Running Club. Though there is scarcely anyone I can beat in a race, I can improve everyday with newfound friends, talking and laughing while running around the beautiful campus, united by our shared passion for running. You’ll definitely catch me running up and down the Elephant Stairs!

Photography is my outlet for self-expression and a way to show the world my perspective. Photography Club offers me the chance to see how others see the world and share ideas with them. Photography allows me to capture and share important moments and ideas, and helps me connect with diverse perspectives at Case. I’m excited to learn about different techniques and approaches to photography to expand my skillset and provide me with more tools to capture stories.

Case is the place where I can learn and grow as a person—the place where I can “Think beyond the possible” and work towards making the future I envision a reality.
