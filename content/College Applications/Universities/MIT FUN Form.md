My team, the Ocean Anchor Bankers, are semifinalists in the Wharton Global High School Investment Competition, one of 55 teams out of nearly 1,400 teams competing in 53 countries. Our investment strategy "anchors" our client, ensuring they will reach their destination even through rough waters—fluctuations in the market. For our video presentation, we're filming a skit where we're pirates, sailing the high seas searching for treasure—our slideshow/pitch. We just finished the script—I'm excited to film!

Our robotics team got 4 teams into the top 10 out of 33 teams at the Philadelphia qualifiers for the FIRST Tech Challenge. 2 made it to the semifinals, and 1 made it to the finals! For the team I'm helping, I programmed the autonomous code in-between matches, successfully getting our robot to detect April Tags to determine which section of the field to travel to during the autonomous period. 

I completed another part of the project I started during MITES Semester—a robotic guide dog (I named her Roselle after a heroic guide dog during 9/11) to take voice input and lead the user to the given destination. I got an Android app to get the current GPS location, take voice input, and set a route. I'm working on pushing data through Bluetooth to the Arduino.

Ever since reading "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" and listening to his lectures/explanations, Richard Feynman has become an inspiration of mine. Here's my favorite quote of his:

"I, a universe of atoms, an atom in the Universe."
