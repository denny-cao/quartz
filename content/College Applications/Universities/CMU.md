**Most students choose their intended major or area of study based on a passion or inspiration that’s developed over time – what passion or inspiration led you to choose this area of study?**

"_Mama_, can I get that?" I pleaded, my finger pointing at the robot toy that imitated the Nao robot.

"No," she sighed. As a child, I was unfamiliar with the concept of money. I didn't know why my parents toiled from day till night at our restaurant, Xin Xing House. I didn't know their struggles, arriving at an unfamiliar country, having to take care of me and my brother. I only understood that the restaurant took away from play time with _mama_ and _baba_.

A month later, I woke up to the knock-off Nao robot on my bedside. I raced to my parents’ room to thank them, but they had already gone to work. I played by myself, watching RoBi—its new name—dance.

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at UPenn to research robotic manipulation and perception. I saw so many cool things: the Cassie robot walk; a robotic arm controlled through a VR headset; I controlled the Franka Panda arm. Tossed into this unfamiliar yet exciting world, I wanted to understand. _What's a mass-spring-damper system? How do force-torque sensors work? Will robots be our future overlords?_

To answer some of my questions, I set up an interview with Professor Dinesh Jayaraman to discuss his work on the perception-action loop of learning for robots. I learned about the similarities between robot and human learning, Held and Hein’s kitten carousel experiment, the ethical implications of robotics. At home, I tried to understand David Silver’s reinforcement learning lectures. 

I’m interested in studying CS to bring robots to jobs roboticists describe as the three 3D's: dull, dirty, and dangerous. I envision a future where robots assist humans, a future where my parents don’t need to work long hours in summer heat, a future where parents can spend time with their kids.


**Many students pursue college for a specific degree, career opportunity or personal goal. Whichever it may be, learning will be critical to achieve your ultimate goal. As you think ahead to the process of learning during your college years, how will you define a successful college experience?**
- social skills
- Talk about research in their labs
- maybe find a group I want to join
- Maybe they have a photography group or smthing
- Robotics ## **Additional Major**!!!!
- commitment to AI ethics:

Building up the confidence to walk up to anyone and talk to them.

Since middle school, I’ve been at a constant fight with my self-confidence. Recently, I’ve gotten more comfortable talking to new people, and aim to continue doing so in college.

I look forward to joining the Running Club. Though there is scarcely anyone I can beat in a race, I can improve everyday with newfound friends, talking and laughing while running around the beautiful campus, united by our shared passion for running.

Joining the Photo Club will also let me be a part of a community where we have similar interests. We can share photographs and learn different techniques from one another. In particular, I’ll explore dark room photography, the focus of the club. I’ve only done digital photography, and it will be a welcoming change—and allow me to use another medium to express myself!

I want to have an Additional Major in robotics to learn more about the field and prepare myself for the Accelerated Graduate Program. With the knowledge from classes such as 85-370 to learn about perception and 10-315 to learn about machine learning, I want to research in the Robotics Institute and join the Intelligent Autonomous Manipulation Lab to advance general purpose robotics. In this collaborative environment, I hope to further my social skills that I developed through interest clubs and talking to others at CMU. In the lab—and around campus—I’ll be encouraged to ask questions. Through discussion and debate over these questions, we’ll find innovative solutions.

CMU’s welcoming community of students and faculty will provide the perfect environment to walk up to someone and ask, “How are you?”
