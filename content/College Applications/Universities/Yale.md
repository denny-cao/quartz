Students at Yale have time to explore their academic interests before committing to one or more major fields of study. Many students either modify their original academic direction or change their minds entirely. As of this moment, what academic areas seem to fit your interests or goals most comfortably? Please indicate up to three from the [list](https://admissions.yale.edu/majors-and-academic-programs) provided.

**Tell us about a topic or idea that excites you and is related to one or more academic areas you selected above. Why are you drawn to it? (200 words or fewer)**

Dull, dangerous, and dirty. To make a living, many are forced into jobs roboticists describe as the three D's. I’m interested in studying computer science to create a future where my parents don’t need to work long hours in summer heat at the restaurant, a future where robots assist humans.

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania to research robotic manipulation and perception with Leon Kim, a graduate student. Within the first few weeks, I saw so many cool things I wanted to learn more about. I saw the Cassie robot walk, a robotic arm controlled through a VR headset. I manually controlled the Franka Panda arm. Tossed into this unfamiliar yet exciting world, I wanted to desperately wanted to explore more about how everything worked. I set up an interview with Professor Dinesh Jayaraman, the PI of Leon’s research group, to discuss his work with the perception-action loop of learning for robots. Interestingly, this cycle mimicked the way humans learn. 

 I want to continue exploring and learning about the interdisciplinary nature of robotics, incorporating even philosophy and neuroscience. I believe Yale is the place I can do that and work to make the future I dream of a reality.

-   What is it about Yale that has led you to apply? (125 words or fewer)

**You are teaching a new Yale course. What is it called?**
- "Exploring the Art and Science of Photography: From Film to Digital"
- "Digital Photography and Image Processing: A Computer Science Approach"

**Reflect on a time when you have worked to enhance a community to which you feel connected. Why have these efforts been meaningful to you? You may define community however you like.**

"Open it!" my dad eagered on. It was *nai nai*'s 60th birthday—my grandmother. Her hands slowly unwrapped our present as we waited in anticipation. She lifted the cover, revealing the latest iPhone—the 6s Max. Her face lit up with joy; for as long as I could remember, she had been using her old Blackberry flip phone. 

The next few months, I became her personal tech support. 

"How do I get WeChat?"
"How do I rotate my screen?"

I began to realize that, despite how beneficial technology is to society, it is extremely esoteric. Those that are unable to use technology are placed at an inherent disadvantage as we shift more and more to a digital society.

During summer break, my friends and I worked to redesign the website of Philadelphia Trail Club, a non-profit hiking club for senior citizens. When we presented it to the senior board members, we were told that it was too confusing. As young, eager designers, we had opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities, which obfuscated information. To make the best website, we needed to collaborate with the club. 

Initially, we thought it would be best to keep the homepage extremely minimal, separating all the information into different pages. However, the board members wanted the majority of the information on the homepage so older people wouldn’t have to navigate through different pages. Their opinion had merit, but too much information was also an issue. I explained our view, how mountains of text would only make it harder to find information, and they agreed. Balance was needed, so I asked members what they thought was most important. We placed the club’s mission, events calendar, and how to join on the homepage and moved everything else to different pages.

For the navigation menu, I asked a few members if we should keep the hamburger menu, or switch to a more standard horizontal navigation menu. They vouched for the latter; some didn’t even know that clicking the hamburger would open the menu!

Wonderful design isn’t just how the website looks; it is also user-friendliness, a lesson learned from our first trial. As we continue working on the website, we are constantly reminded of the value of diverse opinions, as they provide a different perspective that is often overlooked.

**What is something about you that is not included anywhere else in your application?**
Getting to and from school is quite the hassle! It's an hour long trip; I take the 58, transfer to the Market Frankford Line, then to the Broad Street Line, then walk to school and the reverse to get home.

**Yale’s residential colleges regularly host conversations with guests representing a wide range of experiences and accomplishments. What person, past or present, would you invite to speak and what would you ask them to discuss?**
Who: Dr. Kate Darling
Topic: Ethical considerations when designing and developing robotics and AI systems, as well as the potential risks and benefits of these technologies for society.

Why Yale?
Yale, with its liberal arts education, will be a welcoming supplement to my focus in CS; only by learning and understanding the world can we begin to see its problems and have discussions about what can be done. I’ll apply my knowledge through research, specifically in the Interactive Machines Group and help make it possible to work to a future where robots can be integrated into society.  ^a210a0

The collaborative environment of research at Yale is present throughout the school. Its an environment where diverse ideas and opinions can be formed and where sharing them is encouraged. Its an environment where friendly banter is possible, competing against one another in the Tyng Cup. After it all, we can have a laugh and learn together over College Tea.
