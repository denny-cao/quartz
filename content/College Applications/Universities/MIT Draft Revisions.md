BEEP! The red Honda angrily screams behind the 42 bus, rudely interrupting Beyoncé singing in my earbuds. A cloud of smoke from the exhaust blows behind us. The bus does not move an inch despite the light turning green, sitting still along with the rest of traffic, bumper to bumper. A tall, navy-suited man impatiently taps his loafers on the floor, glancing at his watch every few minutes. A lady calls her friend, apologizing that she will be late.

After riding public transportation my entire life, I have become jaded to traffic, factoring in an extra 10-15 minutes for any planned trips. So much time is wasted from sitting around, shifting a few inches every few minutes until reaching a destination, along with extra fuel consumption, causing more pollution.

With technology rapidly advancing, we are fully ready for a change. Strangely, traffic lights have made little innovation since their conception in the 1920s. By detecting traffic density, an autonomous algorithm can easily determine the most efficient lights to display, decreasing congestion. With AI and the Internet-of-Things, why can’t Philadelphia and other overcrowded cities adopt smart traffic lights? I would like to be a part of this revolution to cut down accidents, pollution, and traffic.
  
I finally arrive at my stop, fifteen minutes after I’d planned. I dream of a future where technology can create a safer, greener, more efficient future where people don’t have to worry about being late.

#### Pick what field of study at MIT appeals to you the most right now, and tell us more about why this field of study appeals to you. (100 words or fewer)

Goal: I want to study EECS to learn more about robotics. Share why MIT: Culture of innovation (mens et manus and hacks), education (famous professors: feynman, gilbert strang. Belief in education for all; OpenCourseWare April 4, 2001), opportunities (Research through UROPs), and courses I’m interested in

Life is extremely fragile. Every day, firemen, policemen, and others place themselves at risk. Roboticists describe these jobs as the 3Ds: Dull, dangerous, dirty. Studying EECS will equip me with the skills to create a future where robots do these jobs for us. I can partake in the NEET Thread for Autonomous Machines to apply what I learn to the real world. The thread can match me with UROPs research. Currently, I am interested in working with Alberto Rodriguez, who tackled the same issue of extrinsic contact sensing as I did during my internship to improve robotic perception.

Despite how far technology has come, there are still many pressing issues in society, from climate change to diseases

6-2 will provide me with skills to tackle issues through AI, from traffic to speeding up clinical trials. MIT is built on mens et manus, creating an innovative culture that believes in the application of knowledge. This is evident through the NEET Thread for Autonomous Machines, giving me the chance to expand the application of robotics in real life. It will also match me to summer internships and UROP’s research. Currently, I am interested in working with Alberto Rodriguez, who tackled the same issue of extrinsic contact sensing as I did during my last internship to improve robotic perception.

The sea breeze is friendly. The sun is kind, glistening on the Schuylkill River. The wind picks up various shades of red, orange, and yellow, playfully tossing them around. I have a metallic taste in my throat. “You got this, Denny!” Larry energetically screams. The searing pain in my shins is unbearable. “Pump your arms!” Zijun advises, echoing Coach Comfort. Larry checked his watch: “A hundred meters left!” With all the energy I had left, I raced to the end along with them, being cheered on by my friends, celebrating my first 5K. 

Running allows me to free my mind, take in the scenery, the laughter of my friends running alongside me. On light runs, we joke about the recent episode of Stranger Things, our hour-long struggle to prove the theorem in our discrete mathematics p-set. Sometimes, we don’t talk, simply taking in the moment together. We listen to the rhythmic beat of our steps on the concrete, the birds singing their songs. 

When it comes time for track practice, our competitive nature comes out. “Last one there is a *fei zyu* (fat pig; an inside joke after my friend's younger brother screamed it)!”—no one wants to be called a *fei zyu*. We run as fast as we can, and at the end, when my teammates call me a *fei zyu* for the rest of practice, they laugh and encourage me to go faster the next day.

During summer break my friends and I worked to redesign the website of Philadelphia Trail Club, a non-profit hiking club. Three months later, we finished. I admired the smooth parallax scrolling and streamlined appearance, feeling proud of our achievements.

"No," Ash said disappointingly. "It's too confusing to use." When we presented the website to the board, we encountered a lot of constructive feedback. Their target audience is senior citizens to encourage them to stay active and enjoy nature. Their website has to be straightforward and easy to navigate for people with limited computer skills. However, as young, eager designers, we opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities. This ended up obfuscating information, forcing users to navigate different pages to trace important details and endure unintuitive page layouts. Wonderful design isn’t just how the website looks; wonderful design is also user-friendliness, a humble lesson learned from our first trial. 

Immediately, we started simplifying the website, piece by piece. We started with the navigation menu. We asked a few members if the hamburger navigation worked, or if we should switch to a more standard horizontal navigation menu. They vouched for the latter, some saying that they didn’t even know that clicking the hamburger would open the menu! We learned the value of getting diverse opinions, as they provide a different perspective that is often overlooked. 

#### Tell us about a significant challenge you’ve faced (that you feel comfortable sharing) or something that didn’t go according to plan. How did you manage the situation? (225 words or fewer)

Straight line—crooked, erase; straight line—crooked, erase; straight line, finally perfect! I  stepped back. The result was a far cry from anything labeled “art.” I ferociously balled the chicken scratches and tossed it. Not good enough!

Maybe it started at two years old when I resolved to put on my pajamas independently—and consistently failed. I had always held the principle that, if I did anything, I wouldn't "half-ass it." That meant I would spend hours tinkering with the design of my presentation, or allocate days going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole to figure out a confusing concept, even though I might end up being more and more lost. Seeking perfection—or merely the appearance of perfection—came at a cost. I realized it during the last quarter of junior year when I was overwhelmed with attempting to be perfect in every final project. Eventually, a subpar calculus grade reminded me that failure defined nothing but what I could improve on. So, when my code broke many times, I still kept coding for my internship. When I came last in multiple races, I still kept running. Instead of being perfect, my goal is to be better than I used to be.

I picked up the imperfect ball and flattened it. I hung it up—a comparison from where I first started.

“Any questions?” Mr. Ostrikov asked? We were learning implicit differentation.
“Yes,” I thought. “Why do you differentiate with respect to both y and x? Why do you multiply by dy/dx when you differentiate with respect to y?” I looked around the room. Not a single hand was raised. I hesitated, failing to bring myself to raise my hand, to admit that I didn’t understand the topic. 

I had always been afraid to speak up because I feared being wrong, feared what others thought about me. Starting in middle school, I decided to stand up and fight against my low self confidence.

After realizing I was constantly running away, in sixth grade, I joined debate. I also decided to run for middle school treasurer, forcing me to go up and speak in front of the school. My hands were shaking when it was my turn to speak. I didn’t win, but it was a really good experience for me. 
#### Please tell us more about your cultural background and identity in the space below. (optional; 150 words or fewer)
"Have you eaten yet?" in Fuzhounese, a dialect in the place where my family roots from, is used as a greeting, akin to "How are you?"

It came from the local history of food shortage. Droughts and floods made the yearly harvest unpredictable, and bringing enough food to the table became a key aspect in life. People would check each other "Have you eaten yet?" to make sure everyone was provided. 

My parents have always been strict about not leaving a single grain of rice in my bowl after meals and not using more water than necessary. For a long time, I had naively assumed that was the way they tried to save their sweaty money. Now I realize that they appreciate the blessing of the rich natural resources in the new land and try to cherish them through efficient usage.

# Please tell us if aspects of your identity have been a barrier to educational access and opportunity. (optional, 150 words or fewer)  
Since my parents do not speak English, I had to search for opportunities to explore my interests on my own.

At school, I took advantage of the available resources, joining robotics to explore STEM. When I noticed a lack of CS education at Masterman, I crated new opportunities by creating a programming club. 

I’m constantly intrigued by various topics. However, I never wanted to place a financial burden on my parents, so I opted to not attend paid programs. In 10th grade, I applied for an online course, AI Camp, but after seeing the cost, I decided to not attend. Instead, I looked into free programs. I found an internship at UPenn and MITES Semester, and I am extremely happy to have done them!

My parents’ English skills might have been a blessing in disguise, teaching me how to be independent and take advantage of the resources available to me.
