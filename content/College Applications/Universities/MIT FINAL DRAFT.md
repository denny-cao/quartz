To make a living, many are forced into jobs roboticists describe as the three D's: dull, dangerous, and dirty. I’m interested in studying EECS to create a future where assembly workers aren’t forced to quickly repeat dangerous tasks, a future where my parents don’t need to work long hours in summer heat at the restaurant, a future where robots assist humans.

NEET Thread for Autonomous Machines provides me the opportunity to take robotics project-based courses and apply that knowledge in UROPs, where I can join the Interactive Robotics Group at CSAIL or work with Alberto Rodriguez who researched extrinsic contact estimation.

6-2 will prepare me to tackle societal issues using technology.

To survive, many take jobs roboticists describe as the three D's: dull, dangerous, dirty. I want to study EECS to create a future where assembly workers aren’t forced to quickly repeat dangerous tasks, a future where my parents don’t toil long hours in summer heat, a future where robots help humans.

Through the NEET Thread for Autonomous Machines, I can take project-based courses and apply my newfound knowledge in UROPs, where I can join the Interactive Robotics Group at CSAIL or work with Alberto Rodriguez who researched extrinsic contact estimation.

6-2 will prepare me to tackle societal issues using technology.
