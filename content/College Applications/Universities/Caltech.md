**Why did you choose that area of interest? (CS)**
"Mama, can I get that?" I pleaded, my finger pointing at the robot toy that imitated the Nao robot.

"No," she sighed. As a child, I was unfamiliar with the concept of money. I didn't know why my parents toiled from day till night at our restaurant, Xin Xing House. I didn't know their struggles, arriving at an unfamiliar country, having to take care of me and my brother. I only understood that the restaurant took away from play time with mama and baba.

A month later, I woke up to the knock-off Nao robot on my bedside. I raced to my parents’ room to thank them, but was met with an empty room; they had already gone to work. I played by myself, watching RoBi—its new name—dance. As much as I fell in love with RoBi, I wished my parents were there.

Dull, dangerous, and dirty. To make a living, many are forced into jobs roboticists describe as the three D's. I’m interested in studying computer science to create a future where robots assist humans, a future where my parents don’t need to work long hours in summer heat, a future where parents can spend time with their kids.

**STEM experience/activity #1***

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at UPenn to research robotic manipulation and perception. I saw so many cool things: the Cassie robot walk; a robotic arm controlled through a VR headset; I controlled the Franka Panda arm. Tossed into this unfamiliar yet exciting world, I wanted to understand. _What's a mass-spring-damper system? How do force-torque sensors work?_ Will robots be our future overlords?

To answer some of my questions, I set up an interview with Professor Dinesh Jayaraman to discuss his work on the perception-action loop of learning for robots. I learned about the similarities between robot and human learning, Held and Hein’s kitten carousel experiment, the ethical implications of robotics. At home, I tried to understand David Silver’s reinforcement learning lectures. 

During lunch and TGIF dinners, Adam and Alp shared problems they faced trying to get the Franka to roll a ball in a circle. Junyao marveled at the pace of AI research, sharing how Google built another model, Parti, to convert text into images nearly a month after their Imagen model. Often, I was confused. However, they encouraged me to ask questions. With each answer came even more questions. I continue to seek answers. 

**STEM experience/activity #2**
For my two courses, I created a robot guide dog, Roselle (named after a guide dog who led people out of the twin towers during 9/11), as a proof of concept. My idea actually originated from your idea of using an IMU to calculate position. It got me thinking about the various use cases for location, and I thought about GPS navigation. I attempted to create a robot dog that would follow GPS coordinates provided by some map service to get to a destination given by the user through an Android app. This ended up being a little too ambitious, so I have been continuing to work on it after the academic portion of the program.

I’ve always wanted a dog, but my whole family (me included) is allergic. When the box of electronics from MOSTEC arrived at my doorstep, I immediately knew what I wanted to make: a robotic guide dog to walk to locations and hold small items on its back (I thought of the latter while holding a Pepsi can while walking home from a halal truck).

To develop a prototype, I learned CAD. It was so cool seeing my idea slowly come to life, fine tuning dimensions to ensure the components fit properly. Previously, I immediately dove into projects I started, resulting in a lot of time spent having to fix things I didn’t anticipate. 

When everything was put together (I ended up having to drill many holes and cutting entire sections from the dog because I rushed the CAD—lesson learned!), I didn’t have enough time to implement navigation, presenting only a concept of Roselle. I’m currently learning how to make Android apps to create an application to send GPS coordinates to the Arduino through Bluetooth. I look forward to making my vision of a personal Pepsi carrier—and guide dog—a reality!
