		- Service robotics; Story about parents?
- [Robotarium](https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/)
	- Open to everyone; I want to be a part of this community open to new ideas from anyone
- [Aware Home](https://www.awarehome.gatech.edu/assistive-mobile-manipulation-older-adults-home)
	- A goal of robotics is to make lives easier for everyone. Make lives of elders easier.

	- <blockquote>
At the undergraduate level, AI and ML are mainly found in two threads: Intelligence and Devices. Commonly taken courses include Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Understanding, Knowledge-based AI, Game AI, and Pattern Recognition. Several courses in robotics and computational perception also have an AI or ML aspect. Versions of these courses are also available at the graduate level.

Dull, dangerous, dirty. Factory workers work in dirty and dangerous conditions, forced to mindlessly complete tasks quickly to keep up production. Garbage collectors have to deal with entire neighborhoods’ trash. To make a living, many are forced to take jobs roboticists describe as the 3Ds. I want to study CS to be a part of the rapid improvement of AI and robotics to create a future where workers have more free time to see friends and family, take care of their parents and children, and pursue their true passions.

I want to study at Georgia Tech because of the innovative curriculum for CS through Threads. Threads allow me to focus on a particular subset of the expansive field that is CS. As I want to learn how to use AI to make people’s lives easier, I would join the Intelligence Thread and Devices Thread. After my internship at the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, I have become interested in learning about robotic perception, as it is what enables robots to do tasks. I’m looking forward to learning so much more about the rapidly advancing field that is robotics through Georgia Tech’s minor in robotics!

At Georgia Tech, I can apply the knowledge I learned in class to advancing the future through robotics research. The Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines has many amenities for students to create projects or conduct research. Through the SURE Robotics Program, I can participate in research in field and service robotics to bring robots to jobs in the 3Ds. 

Most importantly, at Georgia Tech, I will be part of a collaborative environment where new ideas are welcome. This is especially shown through IRIM’s Robotarium, providing robots accessible to everyone to foster new ideas and removing the barrier of entry for robotics, something that is extremely expensive. This environment carries onto the various clubs around campus, such as The Agency, Georgia Tech’s AI/ML club. I recall the articles of their Love Machine project, matchmaking students around campus through the power of AI. It is this environment that is open to silly ideas like a machine picking a lover that makes me long to study and be at Georgia Tech.


BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP! The red Honda angrily screams behind the 42 bus, rudely interrupting Beyoncé blasting in my ears. A cloud of smoke from the exhaust blows behind us. The bus doesn’t move an inch despite the light turning green, sitting still along with the rest of traffic, bumper to bumper. A tall, navy-suited man impatiently taps his loafers on the floor, glancing at his watch every few minutes. A lady calls someone, apologizing for her imminent lateness.

Riding public transportation my entire life, I have become jaded to traffic, factoring in an extra 10-15 minutes for any planned trips. So much time is wasted from sitting around, shifting a few inches every few minutes until reaching a destination, along with extra fuel consumption, causing more pollution.

With technology rapidly advancing, we are fully ready for change. Strangely, traffic lights have made little innovation since their conception. By detecting traffic density, an autonomous algorithm can easily determine the most efficient lights to display, decreasing congestion. With AI and the Internet-of-Things, why can’t Philadelphia and other overcrowded cities adopt smart traffic lights?

I finally arrive at my stop, fifteen minutes after I had planned. I dream of a future where AI not only speeds up my commute, but is also used to better the world by solving pressing issues in society.

BEEEEEEP! The red Honda angrily screams behind the 42 bus, rudely interrupting Beyoncé singing in my earbuds. A cloud of smoke from the exhaust blows behind us. The bus does not move an inch despite the light turning green, sitting still along with the rest of traffic, bumper to bumper. A tall, navy-suited man impatiently taps his loafers on the floor, glancing at his watch every few minutes. A lady calls her friend, apologizing that she will be late.

With technology rapidly advancing, we are fully ready for a change. Strangely, traffic lights have made little innovation since their conception in the 1920s. By detecting traffic density, an autonomous algorithm can easily determine the most efficient lights to display, decreasing congestion. With AI and the Internet-of-Things, why can’t Philadelphia and other overcrowded cities adopt smart traffic lights? I would like to be a part of this revolution, using AI to not just cut down accidents, pollution, and traffic, but also solve many other issues.
