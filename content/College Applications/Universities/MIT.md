## Identity
**Please tell us more about your cultural background and identity in the space below.  (_optional; 150 words or fewer_)**

**Please tell us if aspects of your identity have been a barrier to educational access and opportunity.  (_optional; 150 words or fewer_)**
Since my parents do not speak English, I had to search for opportunities to explore my interests on my own. At school, I took advantage of the available resources, joining robotics to explore STEM. When I noticed a lack of CS education at Masterman, I crated new opportunities by starting a programming club.

I’m constantly intrigued by various academic topics. However, I never wanted to place a financial burden on my parents, so I opted to not attend paid programs. In 10th grade, I applied for an online course, AI Camp, but after seeing the cost, I decided to not attend. Instead, I looked into free programs; I found an internship at UPenn and MITES Semester, and I am extremely happy to have done them!  

My parents’ English skills might have been a blessing in disguise, teaching me how to be independent and utilize the resources available to me.
## Application Information
**Pick what field of study at MIT appeals to you the most right now, and tell us more about why this field of study appeals to you. (100 words or fewer)**
To survive, many take jobs roboticists describe as the three D's: dull, dangerous, dirty. I want to study EECS to create a future where assembly workers aren’t forced to hastily repeat dangerous tasks, a future where my parents don’t toil long hours in summer heat, a future where robots help humans.

Through the NEET Thread for Autonomous Machines, I can take project-based courses and apply my newfound knowledge in UROPs, where I can join the Interactive Robotics Group at CSAIL or work with Alberto Rodriguez who researched extrinsic contact estimation.

6-2 will prepare me to tackle societal issues using technology.

## Family Information
**If you think that additional information about your family will give us a more thorough impression of your background, please include it here. (*Optional, 150 words or fewer*)**

## Short Responses
**We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you do simply for the pleasure of it. (*225 words or fewer*)**

The sea breeze is friendly. The sun is kind, glistening on the Schuylkill River. The wind picks up various shades of red, orange, and yellow, playfully tossing them around. I have a metallic taste in my throat. “You got this, Denny!” Larry energetically screams. The searing pain in my shins is unbearable. “Pump your arms!” Zijun advises, echoing Coach Comfort. Larry checked his watch: “A hundred meters left!” With all the energy I had left, I raced to the end along with them, being cheered on by my friends, celebrating my first 5K. 

Running allows me to free my mind, take in the scenery, the laughter of my friends running alongside me. On light runs, we joke about the recent episode of Stranger Things, our hour-long struggle to prove the theorem in our discrete mathematics p-set. Sometimes, we don’t talk, simply taking in the moment together. We listen to the rhythmic beat of our steps on the concrete, the birds singing their songs. 

When it comes time for track practice, our competitive nature comes out. “Last one there is a fat pig!”—no one wants to be called a fat pig. We run as fast as we can, and at the end, when my teammates call me a fat pig for the rest of practice, they laugh and encourage me to go faster the next day.

**Describe the world you come from (for example, your family, school, community, city, or town). How has that world shaped your dreams and aspirations? (*225 words or fewer*)**

BEEP! The red Honda angrily screams behind the 42 bus, rudely interrupting Beyoncé singing in my earbuds. A cloud of smoke from the exhaust blows behind us. The bus does not move an inch despite the light turning green, sitting still along with the rest of traffic, bumper to bumper. A tall, navy-suited man impatiently taps his loafers on the floor, glancing at his watch every few minutes. A lady calls her friend, apologizing that she will be late.

After riding public transportation my entire life, I have become jaded to traffic, factoring in an extra 10-15 minutes for any planned trips. So much time is wasted from sitting around, shifting a few inches every few minutes until reaching a destination, along with extra fuel consumption, causing more pollution.

With technology rapidly advancing, we are fully ready for a change. Strangely, traffic lights have made little innovation since their conception in the 1920s. By detecting traffic density, an autonomous algorithm can easily determine the most efficient lights to display, decreasing congestion. With AI and the Internet-of-Things, why can’t Philadelphia and other overcrowded cities adopt smart traffic lights? I would like to be a part of this revolution, using AI to not just cut down accidents, pollution, and traffic, but also solve many other issues.
  
I finally arrive at my stop, fifteen minutes after I’d planned. I dream of a future where technology can create a safer, greener, more efficient future where people don’t have to worry about being late.

**MIT brings people with diverse backgrounds and experiences together to better the lives of others. Our students work to improve their communities in different ways, from tackling the world’s biggest challenges to being a good friend. Describe one way you have collaborated with people who are different from you to contribute to your community. (*225 words or fewer*)** ^e82812

During summer break, my friends and I worked to redesign the website of Philadelphia Trail Club, a non-profit hiking club for senior citizens. When we presented it to the senior board members, we were told that it was too confusing. As young, eager designers, we had opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities, which obfuscated information.  

We started simplifying the website piece by piece, starting with the navigation menu. We asked a few members if we should use a hamburger navigation or if we should switch to a more standard horizontal navigation menu. They vouched for the latter; some didn’t even know that clicking the hamburger would open the menu!

When considering how to present the information, some board members wanted the majority of the information on the homepage so people didn’t need to navigate to find what they were looking for. We explained how mountains of text would only make it harder to find information, and they agreed. So I asked members what information they thought was most important, and we put those pieces on the homepage.

Wonderful design isn’t just how the website looks; it is also user-friendliness, a lesson learned from our first trial. As we continue working on the website, we are constantly reminded of the value of diverse opinions, as they provide a different perspective that is often overlooked.

**Tell us about a significant challenge you’ve faced (that you feel comfortable sharing) or something that didn’t go according to plan. How did you manage the situation? (*225 words or fewer*)**

I dejectedly stared at the mountain of red text. After hours of debugging, the program still crashed. However, I didn’t want to ask my research mentor, Leon, for help.

I had always been afraid to speak because I feared being wrong, afraid of what others thought about me. In sixth grade, realizing I was constantly running away, I joined debate—the start of my war against my low self confidence. When it was announced that we could run for school treasurer, I penned my name on the form. It was the perfect opportunity; we had to speak in front of the school. The laughter that erupted from my jokes while speaking about selling sparklers to fund Yu-Gi-Oh card packs encouraged me to continue fighting.

The war continued in high school. I talked to more people in class and outside of school. I raised my hand more. 

Another hour passed; even more errors filled the terminal. I pictured Leon’s thoughts if I asked him for help. *He’s stupid.* *How can he not figure it out?* I swallowed my pride and showed him the error. Within minutes of scrolling through my code, he found the bug and explained to me why it was happening. He then asked, “Why didn’t you ask earlier?”

Leon told me something many businesses follow: “fail fast, fail often.” Failing is a valuable way to grow, and by picking myself up from losses more often, I would mature quickly, directly learning from mistakes. I became less afraid to search for help from Leon and other lab members. 

Getting help does not equate to weakness; instead, it requires a stronger mind to recognize opportunities for improvement. Questions push me to develop more quickly than if I did everything alone.

**No application can meet the needs of every individual. If there is significant information that you were not able to include elsewhere in the application, you may include it here. (Many students will leave this section blank—and that’s okay.)**
**Please note, we may not be able to access all links you share. If you have supplemental materials you would like to submit, please refer to our optional [creative portfolios](http://mitadmissions.org/apply/firstyear/portfolios-additional-material/). (_optional; 350 words or fewer_)**
