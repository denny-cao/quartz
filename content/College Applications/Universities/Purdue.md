**How will opportunities at Purdue support your interests, both in and out of the classroom?**
I dream of robots working alongside us, making our lives easier. I'm interested in working in the CoRAL Lab to make general-purpose robotics a reality. Through SURF, I’ll learn more about robotics from faculty members, graduate students, and other SURF participants. I can’t wait for the banquet!

I look forward to exploring my interests with others. In Photography Club, we'll share different views of the world through photography. In Purdue Running Club, though there’s scarcely anyone I can beat in a race, I can improve every day with newfound friends. 

Purdue is where I can make my dreams a reality.

**Briefly discuss your reasons for pursuing the major you selected.**
Dull, dangerous, dirty.  My parents work long hours in summer heat at the restaurant. Garbage collectors have to deal with entire neighborhoods’ trash. Factory laborers work in dirty and dangerous conditions, forced to mindlessly complete tasks quickly to keep up production. To make a living, many are forced to take jobs roboticists describe as the 3Ds. I want to study CS to be a part of the rapid improvement of AI and robotics to create a future where workers have more free time to see friends and family, take care of their parents and children, and pursue their true passions.

**Briefly discuss your reasons for pursuing the second major you selected.**
Witnessing a terrifying bipedal robot that looked like the legs of a kangaroo—Cassie—walk around during my GRASP Lab internship, exhilarated me to understand the unfamiliar yet exciting world. To do so, I interviewed Professor Dinesh Jayaraman. While discussing his work on the perception-action loop, I saw similarities between human and computer learning. Studying AI will let me explore this intersection between neuroscience and CS. I also noted the importance of understanding the ethical implications of robotics—and AI in general. Studying AI at Purdue will help me learn how to use AI responsibly and address issues like racial biases in datasets.


**Please briefly elaborate on one of your extra curricular activities or work experiences**
During summer break, my friends and I worked to redesign the website of Philadelphia Trail Club, a non-profit hiking club for senior citizens. When we presented it to the senior board members, we were told that it was too confusing. As young, eager designers, we had opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities, which obfuscated information.  

We started simplifying the website piece by piece, starting with the navigation menu. We asked a few members if we should use a hamburger navigation or if we should switch to a more standard horizontal navigation menu. They vouched for the latter; some didn’t even know that clicking the hamburger would open the menu!

When considering how to present the information, some board members wanted the majority of the information on the homepage so people didn’t need to navigate to find what they were looking for. We explained how mountains of text would only make it harder to find information, and they agreed. So I asked members what information they thought was most important, and we put those pieces on the homepage.

Wonderful design isn’t just how the website looks; it is also user-friendliness, a lesson learned from our first trial. As I continue working on the website, I’m constantly reminded of the value of diverse opinions, as they provide a different perspective that is often overlooked.
