**A hallmark of the Columbia experience is being able to learn and live in a community with a wide range of perspectives. Tell us about an aspect of your own perspective, viewpoint or lived experience that is important to you, and describe how it has shaped the way you would learn from and contribute to Columbia’s diverse and collaborative community.

During summer break, my friends and I worked to redesign the website of Philadelphia Trail Club, a non-profit hiking club for senior citizens. When we presented it to the senior board members, they said it was too confusing. As young, eager designers, we had opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities, which obfuscated information. To make the best website, we needed to collaborate with the club. 

Initially, we thought it would be best to keep the homepage extremely minimal, separating all the information into different pages. However, the board members wanted the majority of the information on the homepage so older people wouldn’t have to navigate through different pages. Their opinion had merit, but too much information was also an issue. I explained our view, how mountains of text would only make it harder to find information, and they agreed. 

As I continue working on the website, I'm constantly reminded of the value of diverse opinions, as they provide different perspectives that is often overlooked. At Columbia, there will be a multitude of perspectives and therefore ideas to solve problems. In the Community Impact student group, I'll use my voice to foster discussion to create initiatives to support the community.


Growing up in Philadelphia, I've witnessed firsthand the issues that plague the city—from the lack of funding for the school district, to the destruction of Chinatown, to the never-ending search for a good cheesesteak (hint: Pat's and Geno's are overrated). While my knowledge of cheesesteaks won’t be much of use in New York, I know about some issues present in NYC as a large city. 

Armed with my Nikon camera, I will utilize photography to shed light on issues important to me, joining the Spectator Publishing Company to share my images in the Columbia Spectator and The Eye. I will join the

Dull, dangerous, dirty. Factory workers work in dirty and dangerous conditions, forced to mindlessly complete tasks quickly to keep up production. Garbage collectors have to deal with entire neighborhoods’ trash. To make a living, many are forced to take jobs roboticists describe as the 3Ds. I want to study CS to be a part of the rapid improvement of AI and robotics to create a future where workers have more free time to see friends and family, take care of their parents and children, and pursue their true passions.

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at UPenn to research robotic manipulation and perception with Leon Kim, a graduate student. Within the first few weeks, I began to see how much I didn’t know. During lunch and TGIF dinners, I listened as lab members discussed their research. I would come across esoteric words, acronyms, and concepts that were completely foreign. They would notice my confused face and would stop to ask what I didn’t understand, encouraging me to be inquisitive. 

I want to continue studying CS and robotics to continue asking questions, to continue working towards the future I envision.

Core 


Columbia University sits in the heart of one of if not the most diverse and vibrant cities. As such, it offers endless opportunities for learning and growth, both inside and outside of the classroom. Columbia will let me explore the interdisciplinary nature of robotics through courses such as MECE 6616 and COMS 4731. I’m also excited to learn CS from one of the developers of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup!

I’m also drawn to the Core Curriculum. As someone who has interests in both STEM and the humanities, Columbia is the perfect place to continue exploring them. Through Art Humanities, I’ll participate in conversations about what makes an artwork beautiful and the history it holds. Maybe I’ll even be able to incorporate concepts into my own photography! 

Additionally, the culture of New York City, with its emphasis on risk-taking and innovation, will be a perfect fit for me. The energy and spirit of the city will inspire me to push myself further and take more risks in my studies and personal pursuits, and if I ever fail, I’ll always have the support of the Columbia community.

Plus, let's be real, who wouldn't want to go to school in a city where you can get a slice of pizza on every corner?
