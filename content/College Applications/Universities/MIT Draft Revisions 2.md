#### Describe the world you come from (for example, your family, school, community, city, or town). How has that world shaped your dreams and aspirations? (225 words or fewer)

BEEP! The red Honda angrily screams behind the 42 bus, rudely interrupting Beyoncé singing in my earbuds. A cloud of smoke from the exhaust blows behind us. The bus does not move an inch despite the light turning green, sitting still along with the rest of traffic, bumper to bumper. A tall, navy-suited man impatiently taps his loafers on the floor, glancing at his watch every few minutes. A lady calls her friend, apologizing that she will be late.

After riding public transportation my entire life, I have become jaded to traffic, factoring in an extra 10-15 minutes for any planned trips. So much time is wasted from sitting around, shifting a few inches every few minutes until reaching a destination, along with extra fuel consumption, causing more pollution.

With technology rapidly advancing, we are fully ready for a change. Strangely, traffic lights have made little innovation since their conception in the 1920s. By detecting traffic density, an autonomous algorithm can easily determine the most efficient lights to display, decreasing congestion. With AI and the Internet-of-Things, why can’t Philadelphia and other overcrowded cities adopt smart traffic lights? I would like to be a part of this revolution, using AI to not just cut down accidents, pollution, and traffic, but also solve many other issues.
  
I finally arrive at my stop, fifteen minutes after I’d planned. I dream of a future where technology can create a safer, greener, more efficient future where people don’t have to worry about being late.

#### Pick what field of study at MIT appeals to you the most right now, and tell us more about why this field of study appeals to you. (100 words or fewer)

##### Ideas
But I'm less interested in learning all the ins and outs of the computer and the most complex techniques and more interested in the societal effects of our most widespread algorithms as well as the potential effects of those that are emerging. 6-4 gives me the chance to really explore that.

So while I agree it's a far less technical degree than 6-3 or 6-2, I think it's a bit of a mischaracterization to call it a fad major. It is a great and important choice for those less interested in the computer and more interested in how the computer interacts with its user and, just as importantly, the world around it

##### Draft
Dull, dangerous, dirty. To make a living, many are forced to take jobs roboticists describe as the 3Ds. **Factory workers work in dirty and dangerous conditions, forced to mindlessly complete tasks quickly to keep up production. Garbage collectors have to deal with entire neighborhoods’ trash.**

The NEET Thread for Autonomous Machines provides an opportunity to expand robotics to these jobs and will connect me to UROPs, where I can join the Interactive Robotics Group at CSAIL or work with Alberto Rodriguez who tackled the same issue of extrinsic contact sensing as I did during my internship to improve robotic perception.

When I graduate, EECS will have prepared me to tackle societal issues using technology. I’ll learn how to utilize AI to ease people’s lives with robots and fight climate change with smarter traffic lights or electric autonomous vehicles. 

I’m excited to be part of a community rooted in mens et manus, creating an innovative culture that believes in the application of knowledge to make the world better!

#### MIT brings people with diverse backgrounds and experiences together to better the lives of others. Our students work to improve their communities in different ways, from tackling the world’s biggest challenges to being a good friend. Describe one way you have collaborated with people who are different from you to contribute to your community. (225 words or fewer)
**Fix:**
- explicitly state working with senior citizens
- add more collaboration with board members/senior citizens
- use P1 to quickly address what you and your friends worked on and end with how it was too confusing, then have the bulk of your essay focus on working/collaborating with these diverse and different opinions to create a mutually beneficial solution.

During summer break my friends and I worked to redesign the website of Philadelphia Trail Club, a non-profit hiking club for senior citizens to encourage them to stay active and enjoy nature. When we presented it to the board members who were seniors themselves, we were told that it was too confusing.

As young, eager designers, we opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities, which obfuscated information. Wonderful design isn’t just how the website looks; wonderful design is also user-friendliness, a humble lesson learned from our first trial. 

Immediately, we started simplifying the website, piece by piece. We started with the navigation menu. We asked a few members if we should use a hamburger navigation or if we should switch to a more standard horizontal navigation menu. They vouched for the latter; some didn’t even know that clicking the hamburger would open the menu! 

Other times, the solution wasn’t as clear. When considering how to present the information, we thought it would be best to keep the homepage as simple as possible, with the bulk of information separated into different pages. However, some board members wanted majority of the information on the homepage so people didn’t need to navigate different pages to find what they were looking for. Their opinion had merit, but we believed it wouldn’t be good design-wise. I explained how mountains of text would only make it harder to find information, and they agreed. There needed to be a balance, so I asked members what they thought was most important. We put those on the homepage—a calendar, how to join, and the mission statement—and moved everything else to separate pages. 

Wonderful design isn’t just how the website looks; wonderful design is also user-friendliness, a humble lesson learned from our first trial. As we continue working on the website, we are constantly reminded of the value of diverse opinions, as they provide a different perspective that is often overlooked. 

#### Tell us about a significant challenge you’ve faced (that you feel comfortable sharing) or something that didn’t go according to plan. How did you manage the situation? (225 words or fewer)
“Any questions?” Mr. Ostrikov asked? We were learning implicit differentiation.  
“Yes,” I thought. “Why do you differentiate with respect to both y and x? Why do you multiply by dy/dx when you differentiate with respect to y?” I looked around the room. Not a single hand was raised. I hesitated, failing to bring myself to raise my hand, to admit that I didn’t understand the topic.

I had always been afraid to speak up because I feared being wrong, feared what others thought about me. Starting in middle school, I decided to stand up and fight against my low self confidence.

After realizing I was constantly running away, in sixth grade, I joined debate. I also decided to run for middle school treasurer, forcing me to go up and speak in front of the school. I didn’t win, but it was a really good experience for me.

The fight became a war, carrying on into high school. To challenge myself, I started talking to more people. In class, I talked to those that sat next to me. I met students from different schools and learned how to share my opinions and beliefs, as well as the importance of holding onto my personal values.

As Mr. Ostrikov was about to move onto the next slide, my hand shot up.

Over time, I learned the power of asking questions. I learned about implicit differentiation by asking for help. I had my code debugged in a few minutes compared to the few hours it took me during my internship when I reached out to Leon for help. In robotics, asking questions let me get to know everyone better. As I continue my education, I will continue to grow as a person and ask questions.





I dejectedly stared at the mountain of red text—after hours debugging, the program still crashed. However, I didn't want to ask Leon, my research mentor, for help.


I had always been afraid to speak because I feared being wrong, of what others thought about me. In middle school, realizing I was constantly running away, I decided to speak in front of everyone to run for treasurer. The laughter that erupted from my jokes while speaking about selling sparklers to buy Yu-Gi-Oh card packs encouraged me to continue speaking. In high school, I talked to more people in and out of school. I raised my hand more.


As I continued scanning my code, everything I learned disappeared. If I asked Leon, what would he think? He’s stupid. How can he not figure it out? Noticing how much time had gone by, I swallowed my pride and showed him the error, my head hung low. Within minutes, he found the bug and explained the problem. He then asked, “Why didn’t you ask earlier?”

Leon taught me a popular business model: “fail fast, fail often.” It requires a strong will to admit my shortcomings and ask for help, but by doing so, I would learn quickly. I became less afraid to get help from others.

 Questions push me to develop more quickly than if I did everything alone.
