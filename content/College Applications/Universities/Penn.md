**Write a short thank-you note to someone you have not yet thanked and would like to acknowledge. (_We encourage you to share this note with that person, if possible, and reflect on the experience!)_ (150-200 words)**
Hey Leon!

I told a lie when we first met. After you showed Cassie walking at the DAIR Lab, you asked, "is locomotion cooler than manipulation?" I responded with a hesitant "no, of course not!"

The truth is, I had no idea what robotic manipulation even was.

I used to be afraid of being wrong—afraid of not understanding. I remember trying to debug an xacro file for an hour. I imagined what you would think if I asked for help. _He’s stupid_. _How can he not figure it out?_ When I swallowed my pride and asked you for help, you immediately found the error: I wrote <xacro: macro> instead of <xacro:macro>—I added a space!

You told me something many businesses follow: fail fast, fail often. I learned to embrace my mistakes—to use mistakes as opportunities to grow.

I'm going to miss our lunches and TGIF dinners, sitting with Adam, Junyao, Alp, and the others, talking about everything from robotics to anime conventions. But most of all, I'm going to miss working with you. Thank you for giving me the power to ask questions.

Your #1 fan,  
Denny Cao

P.S. Hopefully my gift looks great next to your other figurines!

**How will you explore community at Penn? Consider how Penn will help shape your perspective and identity, and how your identity and perspective will help shape Penn. (150-200 words)**

The rustle of leaves and the whisper of the wind mixes with the indistinct chatter of busy students as I stroll through Locust Walk. I imagine myself as a student.

Growing up in Philadelphia, I’ve witnessed its issues—funding shortages for schools, Chinatown’s destruction, the never-ending search for good cheesesteaks (hint: Pat’s and Geno’s is overrated). At Penn, I’m excited to learn and grow as an individual while also making a positive impact on my community. With my Nikon camera, I’ll shed light on issues, sharing images in The Daily Pennsylvanian and the 34th Street Magazine. I hope to encourage students to become proactive and fight to improve our city. In the Chinese Students’ Association, we’ll celebrate our identities and use our voices to fight for our beliefs, supporting one another as we navigate Penn—and beyond—together. Above all, I’ll steer students away from mediocre cheesesteak joints and towards the hidden gems of Philly.

I look forward to exploring my interests with others. At the Penn Lens Club, we'll share different views of the world through photography. In Penn Club XCTF, though there’s scarcely anyone I can beat in a race, I can improve every day with newfound friends. 

As I continue to take in the sights and sounds of the diverse Penn community, I realize Penn is where I belong.


**Considering the specific [undergraduate school](https://admissions.upenn.edu/exploring-academics-at-penn) you have selected, describe how you intend to explore your academic and intellectual interests at the University of Pennsylvania.** 
When I set out to explore Penn’s engineering complex, I didn’t know I’d end up lost (fourth floor Levine connects to third floor Towne!).  

Starting at the GRASP Lab in room 403, I see students crowded around a desk, discussing a problem. I want to be part of this collaborative environment that combines strengths of different disciplines to find innovative solutions. I envision working with Professor Nadia Figueroa, researching robotic control to create a future where robots work together with humans. I can apply knowledge from concentrating in AI and her class, Introduction to Robotics.

Peering out the window, I note that I’m not isolated to SEAS. I can take Technology, Law & Ethics at the Law School to learn about my responsibilities when creating technology and even The Big Picture: Mural Arts in Philadelphia to learn how art can be a tool for social change.  

My self-guided tour ends at the first floor as I cross from Skirkanich to Moore. The ENIAC sits on display, a testament to Penn's rich history in CIS. I can’t help but feel a sense of excitement and possibility contributing to the next chapter of Penn’s legacy of interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.
