Dull, dangerous, and dirty. To make a living, many are forced into jobs roboticists describe as the three D's. I’m interested in studying computer science to create a future where my parents don’t need to work long hours in summer heat at the restaurant, a future where robots assist humans.

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at UPenn to research robotic manipulation and perception with Leon Kim, a graduate student. Within the first few weeks, I began to see how much I didn’t know. During lunch and TGIF dinners, I listened as lab members discussed their research. I would come across esoteric words, acronyms, and concepts that were completely foreign. They would notice my confused face and would stop to ask what I didn’t understand, encouraging me to be inquisitive. 

Pairing my exploration of CS with a liberal education will encourage me to continue questioning and find innovative solutions; only by learning and understanding the world can we begin to see its problems and have discussions about what can be done. 

At Cornell, I can minor in robotics, where I can learn about its interdisciplinary nature and enroll in CS 1114 and CS 4750 understand how computer science can be applied to robotics. Taking CS 4752 will allow me to continue my learning of robotic manipulation. 

With this knowledge, I hope to research in the Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Controls to further robotic control and learn from Professor Silvia Ferrari. Being a part of a collaborative research environment will allow me to learn more about what must be done to make my dream a reality.
