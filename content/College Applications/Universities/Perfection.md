Straight line—crooked, erase; straight line—crooked, erase; straight line, finally perfect! I  stepped back. The result was a far cry from anything claimed “art.” I ferociously balled the chicken scratches and tossed it. Not good enough!

Maybe it started at two years old when I resolved to put on my pajamas independently—and consistently failed. I had always held the principle that, if I do anything, I wouldn't "half-ass it." That meant I would spend hours making my presentations visually appealing, allocate days going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole to figure out confusing concepts, often times becoming more and more lost. Seeking perfection—or merely the appearance of perfection—came at a cost. I realized it during the last quarter of junior year when I was overwhelmed with attempting to be perfect at every final project. 

In the end, I received a subpar calculus grade. I finally faced what I always feared—failure. However, the world didn’t end. Nothing changed except that I finally recognized my weaknesses. Failure taught me how to manage my time better. Failure taught me how to ask for help. Later, during my internship, I ran into many bugs. I still kept coding. When I came last in multiple races, I still kept running. Failure taught me how to succeed—how to be better than I was yesterday.

I picked up the imperfect ball and flattened it. I hung it up—a comparison from where I first started.

I've always hated failing. Maybe it started at two years old when I resolved to put on my pajamas independently—and consistently failed. I hated each red stroke on assignments. I hated being confused about complex topics. I hated cooking steak too done, rice too watery. I would spend hours attempting to be perfect, making my presentations visually appealing, allocating days going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole to figure out confusing concepts, often times becoming more and more lost. Seeking perfection—or merely the appearance of perfection—came at a cost. No time block was left empty. I realized it during the last quarter of junior year when I was overwhelmed with attempting to be perfect at every final project. 

In the end, I received a subpar calculus grade. I finally faced what I always feared—failure. However, the world didn’t end. Nothing changed except that I finally recognized my weaknesses. Failure taught me how to manage my time better. Failure taught me how to ask for help. Later, during my internship, I ran into many bugs. I still kept coding. When I came last in multiple races, I still kept running. Failure taught me how to succeed far more than success did. How else would I know what I didn't know, what I could improve? I couldn't expect to pick up a pencil to draw and embody Picasso. I *had* to make bad drawings, learn from them, and improve.
