The aqua autumn sea breeze failed to cool me down from the red scorching sun. I tried to ignore it, but the sweat glistening on my forehead hinted at my defeat. Each time my foot struck concrete, the sharp dagger twisted deeper into my abdomen; the side stitches were unbearable. The searing pain in my shins grew more excruciating, their cries for me to stop getting louder. But I couldn’t. My goal was within reach. My breathing became heavy, gasping for air. I came to a sudden halt. I lost my pride that day—and five dollars.   

“An average person runs a nine to ten minute mile,” my brother, Frank, said doubtfully when I asked if I could run a decent mile. I scoffed. _Easy_. I was so confident that I opened my wallet and bet my brother all the money I had—a five-dollar bill.

0.7 miles. I bent over, hands on my knees. Suddenly, a blond-haired kid, maybe four feet and a half, came barreling down, nearly crashing into me, and sprinted off into the distance like a lion chasing its prey. It looked effortless to him, continuing on without breaking a sweat. _There's no way a fifth grader's beating me!_ I chased after him, but the side stitches flared up, silencing all my thoughts. I walked until I reached a mile. The statues of angels playing music became my mile marker; _I'm getting here._

0.7 miles—again. _I’m going further tomorrow._

0.8 miles. _I’m going further tomorrow._

0.8 miles—again. _I’m going further tomorrow._

For a few months, Kelly Drive became my new home after school. I felt like a masochist, willingly putting myself through torture. Many times, I thought about giving up. I could breathe normally again. The pain would go away. However, stopping was an act of surrendering, losing the bet, admitting that I wasn't good enough—that I couldn't improve. I had given up countless times, surrendering to the kids laughing at me during basketball practice, the difficult pieces I couldn't play on piano. I regretted quitting, and I didn't want that to happen again. I kept running until I physically couldn't.

Over time, the torture became euphoric and relaxing, the daily runs becoming a way to destress after long days of school, the thoughts clogging my mind being drowned out by the rhythm of my footsteps and my favorite music.

The last autumn leaf had fallen, leaving all the trees barren; winter was approaching. “Double or nothing!” I exclaimed one November morning. Frank had a confused look on his face until he remembered our initial deal. He scoffed. “Sure,” he replied. I smirked.  

The sea breeze is friendly. The sun is kind, glistening on the Schuylkill River. I have a metallic taste in my throat, but my goal is within reach. In the distance, the mile marker comes into view as Spotify shuffles to Drake’s “God’s Plan.” 0.9 miles at a pace of 10:30 per mile. Gone were the thoughts of controlled breathing, how my foot should strike the ground at the midfoot; pumping my arms. I pant, struggling to absorb as much air as I possibly could through short, rapid breaths. My lungs beg for me to stop, but I keep going. 

Victory buzzes from my phone—1 mile in 10:09.

I proudly knocked on my brother’s door with a smile plastered on my face, handing him ten dollars. He awkwardly took the money, confused why I was so happy losing again. I closed my empty wallet, with confidence I never had before. I didn't give up. Over the course of a few months, I improved tremendously. Whether it takes a week, a month—a year even—if I set a goal and I run towards it every day, I can reach it. There was room for improvement, but I knew I could do it. Right as I was about to leave his room, I spun around. "Double or nothing!"
