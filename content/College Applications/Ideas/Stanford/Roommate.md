# Food

Hey Roomie!

In Fuzhounese, “have you eaten yet?” is used as a greeting, akin to “How are you?” 

In the third grade, I asked my grandma why. She told of a past where there was little to eat. Neighbors would ask each other “have you eaten yet?” to check up on them, to make sure they were okay. Even if they themselves did not have enough food, they would share it to take care of others. Because of this, food has become ingrained into our culture, so much so that my parents and many immigrants started their own restaurants; food has become our “love language.” 

I’d like to extend this to you. If you’re ever hungry, I’ll happily make you my world-renowned burnt scrambled eggs (Cooking ability definitely isn’t hereditary)—or just grab you something to eat from Wilbur. 

I believe food allows us to learn about each other and explore new flavors and traditions. All my life, I’ve been surrounded by Chinese food (I had Chipotle for the first time last summer). I look forward to trying new things, learning about the foods you grew up with, and sharing the fish balls, peanut butter noodles, and wonton I grew up with. 

As we embark on our journey at Stanford together, I think it would be really fun to create a new recipe that blends our interests and leave it behind in the Class of 2027 time capsule. Sure, we might have a few cooking failures along the way, but that's all part of the fun. We can laugh about our mishaps and celebrate our successes together. Who knows, maybe we'll even come up with something that's actually edible!

So roommate, have you eaten yet?
