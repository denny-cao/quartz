##### **What is the most significant challenge that society faces today? (50 word limit)**
“Any questions?” a teacher asks. No hands raise.

This is a common sight in classrooms that reflects a larger issue in society: the fear of asking questions. Many people are hesitant to ask questions for fear of appearing ignorant or making a mistake. 
 
The “Why?” game—a game where children repeatedly ask “Why?”’ suddenly disappears from many when they grow older. Many students I’ve tutored are disinterested with *why* we do something, opting to memorize rather than understand. Innovation and discovery spurs from questions—good and bad. We must foster an environment that encourages curiosity. 

Not getting enough sleep.

In this generation of rapid growth, there is a stigma that, if you’re not working, you’re doing something wrong. This leads many to prioritize their work and other commitments over their personal well-being. I personally have fallen victim to this mentality and have struggled to find value in those precious eight hours, joining the chorus of others bragging about how little sleep we got. 

Its time to normalize eight hours of sleep.


Not wanting to play with fire.

Not in the literal sense, of course—but in the sense of that this loss of curiosity can lead to a lack of innovation and a lack of understanding and critical thinking. It is important for society to foster an environment that stokes the flames of curiosity, in order to promote progress and growth.

We need to encourage kids to play with fire.

##### **What historical moment or event do you wish you could have witnessed? (50 word limit)**
The first steps of the “first electronic person”, Shakey. While not the most visually appealing, it was the first time in history where a robot had sentient qualities, combining perception, decision-making, and action. I wish I could experience the excitement in the room as scientists realized the endless possibilities of what they created, turning science fiction into reality. 

Much of recent inventions stem from Shakey; autonomous vehicles,  speech-based technologies (Siri), navigation (a-star algorithm was originally for Shakey).

One small team made one robot which changed the world.
