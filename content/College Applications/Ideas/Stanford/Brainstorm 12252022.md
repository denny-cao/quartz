In elementary school, I repurposed my Sketchers shoe box as my “question box.” If I couldn’t figure something out in class, I would write down my question on a piece of paper and drop it in the box. Occasionally, I would dig in, pick a random question, and attempt to understand it. Over time, my box has become full, filled with unasked and unanswered questions.

This summer, I interned at the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania to research robotic manipulation and perception with Leon Kim, a graduate student. Within the first few weeks, I saw so many cool things I wanted to learn more about. I saw the Cassie robot walk, a robotic arm controlled through a VR headset. I manually controlled the Franka Panda arm. Tossed into this unfamiliar yet exciting world, I wanted to desperately wanted to explore more about how everything worked. I didn’t know what a mass-spring-damper system was. I didn’t know how force-torque sensors worked. Each time, I would write a new sticky note. Each time, my questions would remain unanswered after endlessly scrolling through Google, trying to absorb pages of esoteric terms and complex explanations.

During lunch and TGIF dinners, I listened as lab members discussed their research and recent developments. Adam and Alp explained problems they were facing trying to get the Franka Panda—a robotic arm—to roll a ball around in a circle. Junyao marveled at the pace of AI research, sharing how Google built another model, Parti, to convert text into images nearly a month after their Imagen model. They would notice how I was confused, and allowed me to ask questions—I didn’t need to write sticky notes! I asked about what they envisioned for the future. I interviewed Leon Kim's advisor, Dinesh Jayaraman, and learned about the past, present, and future of robotics research. He spoke about his work on the perception-action loop for learning and its implications, both for robotics and society. With this newfound knowledge, I wrote my MOSTEC article on the implications of robotics for the future.

On Wednesdays, I sat in on meetings where lab members would share their progress on their research, and others would ask questions. The presenter would answer, increasing the understanding of the listeners, and the presenter would consider factors and methods proposed by others. 

Week by week, I saw the power of asking questions—even “bad” questions. Each question sparked fruitful discussion and collaboration, leading to better understanding and new ideas. I’ve become more excited about learning knowing that its normal to be confused—knowing that I no longer need to keep my questions as just another sticky note.

Improving my time for the annual Dish Run, year by year. It’s an opportunity to 






Even though I’ll most likely be at the back of the pack, I'm embracing the challenge of the annual Dish Run, seeing it as an opportunity to enjoy the race at my own pace and take in all the sights and sounds around me. As I pound the pavement, I'll be feeling the wind of freedom blowing through my hair and soaking up all the beauty of the Stanford campus. It's going to be a great day!


- Make it more like I’m going to try my best rather than half-ass it. Annual. Every year, try to improve.
