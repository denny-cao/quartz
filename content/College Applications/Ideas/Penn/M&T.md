**M&T Prompt 1: Explain how you will use the M&T program to explore your interest in business, engineering, and the intersection of the two. (400-650 words)**

"Mama, can I get that?" I pleaded, my finger pointing at the robot toy that imitated the Nao robot.

"No," she sighed. As a child, I was unfamiliar with the concept of money. I didn't know why my parents toiled from day till night at our restaurant, Xin Xing House. I didn't know their struggles, arriving at an unfamiliar country, having to take care of me and my brother. I only understood that the restaurant took away from play time with mama and baba.

A month later, I woke up to the knock-off Nao robot on my bedside. I raced to my parents’ room to thank them, but was met with an empty room; they had already gone to work. I played by myself, watching RoBi—its new name—dance. As much as I fell in love with RoBi, I wished my parents were there.

Dull, dangerous, and dirty. To make a living, many are forced into jobs roboticists describe as the three D's. I’m interested in studying computer science to create a future where robots assist humans, a future where my parents don’t need to work long hours in summer heat, a future where parents can spend time with their kids. 

M&T will provide me with a foundation to understand how to create an affordable—yet profitable—business to make the future accessible for all while generating enough revenue to continue improving robotics. I will learn how to market products to a society with increasing mistrust against robots. This is particularly in regards to their potential impact on the labor market and personal privacy. As such, it is important to learn how to research target markets, develop marketing strategies, and create messaging that effectively communicates the value and benefits of these products to a skeptical audience. LGST 100: Ethics and Corporate Responsibility will help me mitigate this skepticism by teaching me my ethical obligation as an entrepreneur.

One class I’m particularly excited about is MGMT2370: Management of Technology, where I will learn how to develop business strategies to succeed as an emerging firm and how to continue succeeding as an established one in the fast-paced and constantly evolving technology industry. I can continue to develop the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively start and run a business by concentrating in entrepreneurship and innovation. 

Through the M&T Freshman Seminar, I will be able to learn from those who have succeeded in doing what I dream—bringing technological innovations to the general public. I’m looking forward to Sophomore Immersive Week, being able to journey with peers to innovation hubs to see how successful businesses came to be, and what our future as M&T students holds. 

For my final year, I will be able to work with my peers and synthesize everything we learned from Wharton and SEAS in one final project for the Integration Lab to tackle a societal issue. It will be an opportunity to walk through the entire process of innovation: drafting a potential solution to an idea, prototyping, and finally creating a business strategy to be able to bring the idea to the public. Working with some of the most innovative people in the world and having a world-class faculty member that has many years of experience as a faculty member will be an invaluable experience. I hope to be able to present in the M&T Summit, and if not, celebrate the successes of my friends. 

After a rigorous yet exciting four years, M&T will provide me with a wide range of skills and the confidence to go out in the world to work toward my dream and any other dreams I develop on the way. M&T is where I will succeed.

**M&T Prompt 2: Describe a problem that you solved that showed leadership and creativity. (250 words maximum)***

During summer break, my friends and I worked to redesign the website of Philadelphia Trail Club, a non-profit hiking club for senior citizens. When we presented it to the senior board members, we were told that it was too confusing. As young, eager designers, we had opted for fancy features and complicated functionalities, which obfuscated information.  

We started simplifying the website piece by piece, starting with the navigation menu. I asked a few members if we should use a hamburger navigation or if we should switch to a more standard horizontal navigation menu. They vouched for the latter; some didn’t even know that clicking the hamburger would open the menu!

When considering how to present the information, some board members wanted the majority of the information on the homepage so people didn’t need to navigate to find what they were looking for. I explained how mountains of text would only make it harder to find information, and they agreed. So I asked members what information they thought was most important, and we put those pieces on the homepage.

Wonderful design isn’t just how the website looks; it is also user-friendliness, a lesson learned from our first trial. As we continue working on the website, we are constantly reminded of the value of diverse opinions, as they provide a different perspective that is often overlooked.
