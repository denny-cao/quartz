The primary ingredient in nail polish is nitrocellulose, a compound also used to produce explosives. Now, I haven’t seen anyone pull out a bottle of ostentatious green lacquer in the midst of an argument, but I would not cross it off the list of catastrophic weapons in disguise. I’ve grown up around nail polish my whole life, my academic and social life carefully crafted around the walls of my mom’s salon -and our home. My mom’s nail salon, which sits bashfully on 6th and Market Street, looks as if it’s stuck between two eras with its perennially rusting gates and bright neon signs. Behind the cacophony of broken English, mechanical sounds emitting from drill bits, and frivolous songs nest a small yet oddly quaint room, covering a little less than eighty-one square feet. For the entirety of my elementary years, that room doubled as both our storage room and bedroom. 

After school every day, like clockwork, I found myself cautiously peering into the windows of the salon, surveying the customers milling about inside before gracing them with my reluctant presence. More than the smell of nitrocellulose and acetone, I dreaded the onslaught of feet I encountered -thick toes, green toes, no toes. I felt like I had stepped into a rendition of Dr. Seuss gone horrendously wrong.

When the last of the customers exited, and the sky a vast infinity of deep indigo, the locks of our salon would click into place, and the rooms labeled, Employees Only, became our living quarters. A mixture of Fujianese and Mandarin replaced broken English, the sound of the refrigerator humming superseded the drill bits, and speakers played Chinese classics rather than the frivolous songs. My designated homework area was adjacent to the altar, and every so often, I would feel the eyes of the gold Buddha burning holes in the back of my head.

As our family grew bigger, we moved to an apartment where six people split up two rooms, and fought over the shower. The lines between school, home, and work blurred. Mornings before school were reserved for opening the shop, folding towels, and restocking supplies, and nighttimes after school were spent in the nail salon, assisting clients, answering calls, and reading documents. My peacetime was twilight—prime sleep hours I traded for more time on assignments. My mother’s insistence on my punctual arrival at work after school prompted biweekly arguments, accumulating in a bag of clothes thrown out the front door and me trudging to the apartment next door. Desperate to escape the salon fumes and tensions at home, I turned to school organizations as an escape: Robotics, Science Olympiad, and orchestra. At these clubs, I formed close ties with mentors whom I would turn to for support. With their guidance, I learned how to nurture the extracurriculars that catered to my interests, in lieu of inundating my schedule with arbitrary events. 

Coming to terms with my personal interests allowed me to acknowledge the nail salon from a different perspective. Acceptance and compromise became common ground. The once stifling atmosphere softened into a familiar and comforting routine, as I became more cognizant of the community that had formed within the walls; long-term customers wrapped me in their embrace, whispering, “Long time no see! You’re so tall now!” Conversations about my academic endeavors, aspirations, and hobbies opened the door to numerous opportunities: I was invited over for holidays, on tucked-away hiking trails, and visits to offices. Despite the initial ambivalence, I learned to love the chatter of clients as I trimmed their cuticles and polished their nails. Now that I’ve found an interesting balance between the vastly different aspects of my life, I hope to continue facilitating the interests I accrued throughout the years. Maneuvering the meanders etched in the course of my life took a while, but I think I can proudly say, I’ve nailed it. (Pun intended).

Dear Bagel shūshu (uncle),

I never thought I’d be a fan of cinnamon raisin bagels; in fact, I stood quite firm on my stance that cinnamon raisin bagels were THE worst bagels to ever grace the world. So this letter is, first and foremost, a big hug of gratitude for pushing me out of my comfort zone of “plain toasted bagels with lots of cream cheese” and into a world bursting with sweet, savory, and piquant flavors.   

Beyond teaching me the ways of a bagel connoisseur, I would also like to thank you for indulging in my incoherent wails about the various antagonists I’ve battled in the short amount of time I’ve been alive. Thank you for sharing with me the precious life lessons you’ve learned as a Chinese immigrant. Thank you, for ingraining in me the importance of personal values. And, thank you for reminding me that youth is an evanescent, yet beautiful moment in life. I know that as the sole clerk of a deli, you have your share of obligations, so I appreciate it all the more.

Your future bagel apprentice, 
Mèimei  

  

P.s. Don’t forget your promise of making me your first bagel apprentice!

  

**How will you explore community at Penn? Consider how Penn will help shape your perspective and identity, and how your identity and perspective will help shape Penn. (150-200 words)**

  

My exploration of the community at Penn began at the tender age of twelve when my cousin took me on a tour of his campus, Drexel. When I pointed to a building in the distance, he joked, “Our mèimei is a Penn student, eh?” 

  

And I will be.

  

As an Asian American youth, I’ve witnessed both the beauty of Philadelphia’s cultural enclaves and the horrors of gentrification, poverty, and discrimination. My first-hand understanding of where our city stands in terms of progress/policy-making will contribute to Penn’s powerful group of diverse and highly-driven students who hope to change their communities. Through my participation in The Daily Pennsylvanian and Chinese Student Association, I wish to empower other Penn students to be proud of their identity, and use their voices to stand up for their beliefs. 



On a more lighthearted note, I also believe that a corny joke and an easy laugh can foster tight-knit communities. I am confident that my easy-going nature will make me the optimal candidate for Penn’s Ultimate Frisbee team (My throws? Career ending!) and Band (My viola solo? Tear-provoking!). Penn’s multitude of communities will allow me to harness my interests that go beyond just academics.  

  

**Considering the specific undergraduate school you have selected, describe how you intend to explore your academic and intellectual interests at the University of Pennsylvania. (150-200 words)**



Even though I’m not sure what exactly I would like to address myself as in the future, I know that my work will involve improving the healthcare support of those in marginalized communities in Philadelphia. Due to the nature of my mom’s occupation, I witnessed from a young age the polarizing spectrums of support across racial and socioeconomic lines. 

At Penn, I would like to bridge the gap between healthcare and serving underrepresented communities by taking advantage of the researchers and state-of-the-art technology on Penn’s campus. I am particularly interested in the work of Professor Marc Schmidt, who investigates neural mechanisms that lead to group cohesion and mating success. The most striking aspect of his research to me, however, is the cross-disciplinary aspect of it. Being able to work closely with Penn’s School of Engineering, more specifically their GRASP laboratory, would be an opportunity that I would like to pursue. The ability to understand the complexity of behavior in animals can aid in my goal of bringing together underserved communities. The College of Arts & Sciences also has a plethora of global study-abroad opportunities, such as Scotland’s University of Edinburgh, whose school of biological sciences is ranked 5th in the UK. 

  

**LSM Prompt: The LSM program aims to provide students with a fundamental understanding of the life sciences and their management with an eye to identifying, advancing and implementing innovations. What issues would you want to address using the understanding gained from such a program? Note that this essay should be distinct from your single degree essay. (400-650 words)**

  

By textbook definition, pain is physical suffering or discomfort caused by illness or injury. Pain is essential for survival; it tells us when we need to see a doctor and when something is wrong with our bodies. However, for patients diagnosed with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), pain plays no part in their lives. Due to mutations in the NTRK1 gene, the NGFBeta protein does not transmit signals, which leads to the loss of sensory neurons through a process called apoptosis. The large majority of CIPA patients don’t live over the age of twenty-five due to the inability to detect abnormal activity within their own bodies. When I stumbled across the set of peculiar symptoms that accompanied the disorder, I became fascinated with the complexity of the ostensibly small neurons that have such large implications for the human body. 

  

My desire to gain hands-on experience prompted in-depth assessments of various labs that conducted research relating to neurological diseases like CIPA. One lab in particular that aligns closely with my interests is the Maday lab at Penn Medicine. Professor Sandra Maday and her team work extensively with autophagy proteins that are linked to the progression of neurological diseases. By joining her team, I hope to investigate specific mutations located in different domains of a protein and how autophagy can be adapted for treatment purposes. Through the scientific internship opportunities provided by the program, I hope to see how the skills I learn in the classroom bear fruit in the laboratory setting, and develop therapeutic products to alleviate the severity of such disorders. 

  

However, the effort I put into discovery and research will have virtually no impact if the barriers that prevent novel drugs and technologies from reaching those in dire need of them are not eliminated. In America alone, millions of people go without critical medication because of the exorbitant price tags placed on them and also because of a lack of proper insurance coverage. These kinds of pressing issues are amplified when racial and socio-economical factors are taken into consideration. The College’s courses will further my understanding of how cultural elements play a significant role in the business environment. By the same token, Wharton School’s Global Economy, Business, and Society course will aid in my understanding of how national and international policies impact the marketing and selling of specific healthcare products. The LSM-specific courses, LSMP 1210 and LSMP 4210, encapsulate the interdisciplinary nature of biology and business that will be crucial in my future aspirations. Both seminars will expand my knowledge of how to effectively manage the research and production of drugs and technologies, while nourishing my management skills and ability to generate effective business plans.

Through the LSM program, I hope to bridge the gap between biology and business by creating life-changing medication and providing such services to those in communities that are historically underserved. To create a cure is not enough; I want to be part of the process that tests, approves, and distributes the treatment. I want to ensure that transparency, accountability, and integrity exist within the field. I believe that distribution of drugs is also an issue that needs to be addressed. When COVID-19 vaccines were rolling out, developing countries saw much less progress: only three percent of people in low-income countries were administered at least one dose of the vaccine. These kinds of inequalities can have consequences on a national and global scale. Working towards equitable distribution of drugs and eventually creating my own company to supply free vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and technologies to developing countries such as those located in the Sub-Saharan Africa, Haiti, and Yemen is another long-term goal of mine. I hope to integrate the management skills provided by the Wharton School with the research skills I obtain through the College of Arts and Sciences to produce life-saving products and make them accessible for everyone.
