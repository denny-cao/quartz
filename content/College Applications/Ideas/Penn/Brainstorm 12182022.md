To the halal truck on 36th and Spruce,

I still remember my first day of class, strolling aimlessly as my stomach growled, searching for something to eat at 6:00 PM. The halal truck camping 34th and Chestnut across Levine was packing up, ready to leave. Tyson Bees was completely gone. I continued down Spruce, empty in my stomach and in spirit. Then I came across your cart. Pictures of savory lamb gyros, crispy falafel, filled chicken platters covered the cart. The waft of the earthy aroma of the rice mixed with the gamey smell of lamb immediately settled the decision of what I would get. “Lamb over rice, please!” As you filled the container with rice, stacked fresh lettuce, onions, and tomatoes on the right, and laid a generous portion of lamb, I fiddled around through my wallet, then my pants, realizing that I had no money.

**Issues: It doesnt read like a letter??**

write a thank you note to my graduate student research mentor, Leon Kim. Call myself his number 1 fan. He helped me with code, helped me gain confidence in asking questions rather than trying to figure things out on my own (fail fast, fail often). He took me out to eat my last week of my internship. We researched extrinsic contact estimation for robots in the GRASP Lab at UPenn. We ate lunch together with his labmates. During Fridays, they held TGIF dinners and we sat around with his friends, talking about anything, from current robotics research, to Leon's old high school tjhsst and the controversy of a student claiming they got accepted into a joint program with harvard and stanford, even forging an email until students found that it was spoofed. Leon let me into meetings on wednesday mornings where his labmates at the DAIR Lab discussed their findings in presentations. He explained robotics topics like Mass-spring-damper models, degrees of rotation, force torque sensors. For my other summer program, MOSTEC, he helped me gather ideas for my robotics course project. He gave the idea of using an IMU to track position and give an approximate location using double integration of acceleration for when GPS cannot be used like when you are in a cave. Ultimately, I decided on a robotic guide dog, and he helped with my CAD and called it cute. We had two desks and he sat to my right. He talked about anime and going to anime conventions. I bought him an anime figurine, Rei Ayanami. This letter comes with the gift. He always had a skateboard and would skateboard out of the GRASP Lab to meetings. He was funny, kind, and really accepting of my failures. He sent me his college essays and his friends. He wrote my letter of recommendation as well. Lent me laptop. Thick Asus Gaming laptop. Asked me if I thought robotic locomotion was cooler than robotic manipulation. Seeing Cassie walk, of course, I thought locomotion. Showed  me  how cool manipulation is. 

I hope you enjoy the gift that accompanies this letter - a small token of my appreciation for all that you have done.


- Writing will let me convey all my feelings that words alone cannot.

Struggling. 12 oclock u come in like clockwork and ssave the day. 

Your number 1 fan, Denny Cao




Hey Leon!

I must confess—I told a lie when we first met. After you showed Cassie walking at the DAIR Lab, you asked, “so is locomotion cooler than manipulation?” I responded with a hesitant “no, of course not!” 

I had no clue what robotic manipulation entailed. All I knew at the time was that each step Cassie took was ten—no, closer to a hundred—times cooler than watching a simulation of the Franka arm on a computer screen. 

After pestering you with questions for these past two months, I went from

to being able to confidently present your research on extrinsic contact estimation during the closing ceremony. 

I can confidently say, robotic manipulation is way cooler than robotic locomotion!


Showed me both the exciting and boring parts of research
- Set up
- Watched discoveries of Adam






hat I wanted to do. I loved the sense of community, the laughter, sitting around in round table, eating, drinking, talking about things. Nostalgia. Somehow invoke that feeling that reader is there with me, watching them being a part of the moment. The last TGIF Friday. 

That could be the way I spin it. I write this on the last TGIF Friday. Our last week is approaching. This is my last TGIF Friday. We sit around.


Hey Leon!

I must confess—I told a lie when we first met. 

After you showed Cassie walking at the DAIR Lab, you asked, “so is locomotion cooler than manipulation?” I responded with a hesitant “no, of course not!” 

At the time, each step Cassie took was ten—no, probably closer to a hundred—times cooler than watching a simulation of the Franka arm on a computer screen. To be honest, I didn’t even know what robotic manipulation entailed. 

After pestering you for the past two months with questions—good and bad—ranging from how impedance control works with spring mass-damper systems to how **(add a stupid question)**, I’ve come to realize that I was wrong. Sitting through your lab meetings and interviewing Dinesh about his research in the perception-action loop gave me an insight on just how difficult and exciting robotic manipulation is, having to make intricate and precise control of a robot’s movements to complete tasks. 

Most importantly, you taught me about myself. I used to be so afraid of failure. I wanted everything to be perfect, and I was terrified of making mistakes. Every line of code you helped fix, every challenge you helped me overcome, every mistake I made and learned from, helped me realize that it's okay to not be perfect. I learned to embrace my mistakes and use them as opportunities to grow and improve. You showed me that it's not about being perfect, it's about trying my best and being resilient when things don't go as planned.

I’m going to miss the lunches and TGIF dinners, sitting with Adam, Junyao, Alp, among others, discussing recent developments in robotics, the controversies from your high school, the anime convention you were going to attend. 


Hey Leon!

I told a lie when we first met. After you showed Cassie walking at the DAIR Lab, you asked, "is locomotion cooler than manipulation?" I responded with a hesitant "no, of course not!" 

The truth is, I had no idea what robotic manipulation even was. 

I used to be afraid of being wrong—afraid of not understanding. Working with you and facing challenges and mistakes has helped me realize that it's okay to not be perfect. I remember trying to debug an xacro file for an hour, constantly met with mountains of red error text. I thought what you would say if I asked for help. *He’s stupid.* *How can he not figure it out?* When I swallowed my pride and asked you for help, you immediately found the error: it was supposed to be <xacro:macro> instead of <xacro: macro>—I added a space!

You told me something businesses follow: fail fast, fail often. Failing is a valuable way to grow, and by picking myself up from losses, I would mature quickly, directly learning from mistakes. 


I'm going to miss our lunches and TGIF dinners, sitting with Adam, Junyao, Alp, and the rest of the labmates, talking about everything from recent developments in robotics to your high school controversies to anime conventions. But most of all, I'm going to miss working with you and learning from you. Thank you for being such a great mentor and for all that you've done for me.

Your #1 fan,
Denny Cao

P.S. Hopefully my gift looks great next to your other figurines!

	I dejectedly stared at the mountain of red text. After hours of debugging, the program still crashed. However, I didn’t want to ask my research mentor, Leon, for help.

	I had always been afraid to speak because I feared being wrong, afraid of what others thought about me. In sixth grade, realizing I was constantly running away, I joined debate—the start of my war against my low self confidence. When it was announced that we could run for school treasurer, I penned my name on the form. It was the perfect opportunity; we had to speak in front of the school. The laughter that erupted from my jokes while speaking about selling sparklers to fund Yu-Gi-Oh card packs encouraged me to continue fighting.

	The war continued in high school. I talked to more people in class and outside of school. I raised my hand more. 

	Another hour passed; even more errors filled the terminal. I pictured Leon’s thoughts if I asked him for help. *He’s stupid.* *How can he not figure it out?* I swallowed my pride and showed him the error. Within minutes of scrolling through my code, he found the bug and explained to me why it was happening. He then asked, “Why didn’t you ask earlier?”

	Leon told me something many businesses follow: “fail fast, fail often.” Failing is a valuable way to grow, and by picking myself up from losses more often, I would mature quickly, directly learning from mistakes. I became less afraid to search for help from Leon and other lab members. 

	Getting help does not equate to weakness; instead, it requires a stronger mind to recognize opportunities for improvement. Questions push me to develop more quickly than if I did everything alone.

I witnessed first hand the interdisciplinary of technology that was further emphasized by the connection of the engineering buildings. SEAS offers a level of collaboration that is not present anywhere else. At the GRASP lab, I'm able to not just ask my mentor for help, but the other people in the lab. Everyone is curious and driven, and eager to share their new findings. 

The history of Penn sets it apart. Being the first university, it has so much history, with the ENIAC—the first general purpose computer—located in the Moore building. There is a culture that has accumulated over time of ingenuity and innovation. 

I want to take advantage of the collaborative nature of SEAS, reaching out to others who are more skilled in areas where I struggle for help. During my internship, I’ve developed an interest in robotic manipulation, an area that Penn is actively researching, through the DAIR Lab and PAL Group. I would love to be able to return as an intern at GRASP for my undergrad, and continue to explore the field of robotics.

I want to go to Penn 


The orange leaves rustle as the autumn winds 

The rustle of leaves and the whisper of the wind through the branches overhead mix with the indistinctive chatter of busy students as I stroll through Locust Walk, hugging my bag of lamb over rice close to my body. I’m going to be a Quaker, I tell myself—or, at least, that's what I'll say when people ask why I'm wearing so much maroon and blue.

Growing up in Philadelphia, I've seen firsthand the issues that plague the city - from the lack of funding for the school district, to the destruction of Chinatown, to the never-ending search for a good cheesesteak (hint: Pat's and Geno's are overrated). At Penn, I can act as a bridge for students to the city, steering them away from overpriced and mediocre cheesesteak joints and towards the real hidden gems of Philly. More importantly, with my Nikon camera, I will use photography to shed light on issues important to me, sharing images in The Daily Pennsylvanian and the 34th Street Magazine.



	Raised from cheesesteaks and routine delays of the L, I can act as a bridge for students to the city, steering them away from overpriced and mediocre Pat’s and Geno’s.

From my summer evening mile runs in Franklin Field, I imagine myself in Penn Club XCTF. Though there is scarcely anyone I can beat in a race, I can improve everyday with newfound friends. During competitions, I can cheer on teammates and take pictures of their victories—after coming last in my race.

As I continue to take in the sights and sounds of the diverse Penn community, I am filled with excitement and determination. Penn is the place I belong.

 Amidst all of this, I can't help but feel a sense of excitement and longing to be a part of this community. The energy of the students, the beauty of the campus, and the feeling of being surrounded by intellectual curiosity all combine to make me realize that


As you walk through Locust Walk at UPenn, the autumn winds swirl around you, rustling the leaves of the trees overhead. The leaves, a riot of red and gold, dance and flutter in the breeze, cascading to the ground like a shower of confetti. The air is crisp and cool, tinged with the scent of woodsmoke and the earthy aroma of fallen leaves. You hug your bag of lamb over rice close to your body, savoring the warmth and comforting scent emanating from the bag. The rustle of leaves and the whisper of the wind through the branches overhead provide a soothing soundtrack to your walk.

But as someone who's been raised on cheesesteaks and the routine delays of the L, I know this city like the back of my hand. So, I'm hoping to act as a bridge for students coming from out of town - steering them away from overpriced and mediocre cheesesteak joints and towards the real hidden gems of Philly.

With my Nikon camera, I plan to use photography as a medium to bring about change and bring attention to important issues. My goal is to get my images published in The Daily Pennsylvanian and the 34th Street Magazine, where I can use my artistic skills to shed light on the issues that matter most to me.

And when I'm not busy taking photos or protesting gentrification, you can probably find me at Franklin Field, pretending to be a track star as I try to keep up with the rest of Penn Club XCTF. Sure, there may not be anyone I can beat in a race, but that won't stop me from trying (and probably coming in last). But hey, at least I'll have plenty of time to cheer on my teammates and snap some victory photos for them.

When I had the idea to explore the engineering complex, I did not imagine being  
 4th floor Levine connected to 3rd floor Towne, and through a corridor, connected to Skirkanich (which also connected back to Levine), forming a labyrinth filled with labs,  

I can't help but feel a sense of excitement and possibility—there is so much to explore and learn. I make my way through Skirkanich and catch a glimpse of the ENIAC sitting proudly in display, a testament to the university’s rich history in computer science. 

walk through the halls of UPenn's engineering building complex, I can't help but feel a sense of excitement and possibility. The ENIAC, one of the first general-purpose electronic computers, sits proudly on display, a testament to the university's rich history in the field of computer science. As I wander through the maze of corridors and labs, I can't help but feel a bit overwhelmed - there is so much to explore and learn. But as I watch students and researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds collaborate on projects, I am struck by the strong sense of community and shared purpose that pervades the engineering building complex. It is clear to me that UPenn's engineering program is a place where students and researchers come together to push the boundaries of what is possible and to make a meaningful impact in the world. I can't wait to be a part of it all.



When I first set out to explore Penn's engineering complex, I had no idea I'd end up so completely and utterly lost. I've always been a bit directionally challenged, but this was a whole new level of disorientation (4th floor Levine connects to 3rd floor Towne!). As I wandered the seemingly endless corridors, peering into labs filled with all sorts of mysterious machinery, I noticed a sense of community and collaboration that permeates every corner of SEAS, emphasized by the connection of the buildings. Each lab buzzed with activity, as students and researchers from various disciplines collaborated on projects. 

GRASP Lab is a prime example of this, placing a strong emphasis in interdisciplinary research, drawing on the strengths of different disciplines to find innovative solutions.

Starting at the GRASP Lab at 403, I envision myself in the DAIR Lab group, working with Professor Michael Posa to continue my research on robotic manipulation to bring us closer to a future where robots can do work that humans do not want to, specifically in the 3Ds: dirty, dull, and dangerous.
