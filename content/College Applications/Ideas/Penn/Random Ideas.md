This interconnected and integrated learning environment allows students to easily explore a wide range of academic and intellectual interests within engineering. It also enables students to collaborate with their peers and faculty across different disciplines and departments, fostering a sense of community and interdisciplinary collaboration. I am excited to be a part of this vibrant and dynamic community at SEAS and to explore my interests in engineering at the University of Pennsylvania.

The General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception (GRASP) Lab at the University of Pennsylvania is a world-renowned research center focused on advancing the field of robotics. Established in 1979, the GRASP Lab has consistently been at the forefront of robotics research, with a particular emphasis on the development of intelligent robots that can operate in complex and dynamic environments.

One of the unique aspects of the GRASP Lab is its interdisciplinary approach to research. The lab brings together researchers from a variety of disciplines, including electrical engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, and neuroscience, to work on projects that span a wide range of areas within robotics. This interdisciplinary approach allows the GRASP Lab to tackle some of the most challenging problems in robotics, such as developing robots that can adapt to changing environments and interact with humans in a natural and intuitive way.

The GRASP Lab also has a strong focus on education and outreach, offering a number of research and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. These opportunities allow students to work alongside experienced researchers and to contribute to cutting-edge research projects in robotics. I am excited about the prospect of being a part of the GRASP Lab community and contributing to the development of intelligent robots that can make a positive impact on the world.

At the University of Pennsylvania, you have the opportunity to study in one of four undergraduate schools: the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Nursing, or the Wharton School of Business. Each school offers a unique academic experience, and you can tailor your education to fit your specific interests and goals.

The "4 schools, 1 university" model allows you to take advantage of the resources and opportunities available at all four schools, while also receiving a strong foundation in a specific area of study. For example, if you are interested in engineering and also want to study biology, you can enroll in the School of Engineering and Applied Science and take courses in the College of Arts and Sciences.

This interdisciplinary approach to education allows you to explore multiple areas of interest and gain a well-rounded perspective. You can also participate in cross-school initiatives and programs, such as the Integrated Studies Program, which allows you to design your own major by combining courses from different schools.

Overall, the "4 schools, 1 university" model at the University of Pennsylvania provides you with the flexibility to pursue your academic and intellectual interests in a way that best fits your needs and goals.

ENIAC was revolutionary for its time, as it was the first computer that could be programmed to perform a wide range of tasks. It was also the first computer to use binary digits (bits) to represent data, which is a fundamental concept in modern computers.

One of the unique aspects of the University of Pennsylvania is its rich history in the field of computer science and engineering. The development of the ENIAC at the University's Moore School of Electrical Engineering played a crucial role in the evolution of modern computing and is a source of pride for the university. As a prospective computer science student at Penn, I am excited to explore this history and be a part of the university's continued innovation in the field.
