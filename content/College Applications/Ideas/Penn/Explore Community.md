Growing up in Philadelphia, I've witnessed the problems of Philadelphia—from the lack of funding for the school district, to the destruction of Chinatown, to the never-ending search for a good cheesesteak (hint: Pat's and Geno's are overrated). At Penn, I’ll act as a bridge for students to the city, steering them away from mediocre cheesesteak joints and towards the real hidden gems of Philly. More importantly, with my Nikon camera, I will use photography to shed light on issues important to me, sharing images in The Daily Pennsylvanian and the 34th Street Magazine.  

From my summer evening mile runs in Franklin Field, I imagine myself in Penn Club XCTF. Though there is scarcely anyone I can beat in a race, I can improve everyday with newfound friends. During competitions, I can cheer on teammates and take pictures of their victories—after coming last in my race.


The rustle of leaves and the whisper of the wind through the branches overhead mixes with the indistinctive chatter of busy students as I stroll through Locust Walk. I imagine myself as a student.

More importantly, with my Nikon camera, I will shed light on issues, sharing images in The Daily Pennsylvanian and the 34th Street Magazine. At cultural centers such as PAACH, hubs such as P1P, and clubs such as Chinese Students’ Association, we’ll celebrate our identities (looking forward to the annual Dumpling Fest!) and use our voices to fight for our beliefs and support one another as we navigate Penn—and beyond—together.

Penn also includes communities where I can explore my interests. Photography is my outlet for self-expression and a way to show the world my perspective. The Penn Lens Club offers me the chance to see how others see the world and share ideas with them. From my summer evening mile runs in Franklin Field, I imagine myself in Penn Club XCTF. Though there is scarcely anyone I can beat in a race, I can improve everyday with newfound friends. 

As I continue to take in the sights and sounds of the diverse Penn community, hugging my bag of lamb over rice close to my body, I’m filled with excitement and determination. Penn is where I belong.

Photography allows me to capture and share important moments and ideas, and helps me connect with diverse perspectives at Penn.

The leaves, a riot of red and gold, dance and flutter in the breeze, cascading to the ground like a shower of confetti. The air is crisp and cool, tinged with the scent of woodsmoke and the earthy aroma of fallen leaves. You hug your bag of lamb over rice close to your body,
