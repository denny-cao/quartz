“Siĕh lō̤ muôi?”—“Have you eaten yet?” in Fuzhounese—is synonymous to “How are you?”  

As hunger becomes a less prevalent issue, the phrase is being phased out of the vocabulary of speakers. However, this principle of loving others and overcoming struggles together is still ingrained in our culture.

"Siĕh lō̤ muôi?"—"Have you eaten yet?" in Fuzhounese—is used as a greeting, sort of like "How are you?" It seems like a weird greeting, but there is a lot of cultural history embedded in the simple phrase.

When my grandparents were young, hunger was prevalent in China. Some months, there would be a lot of food. Some months, there would be droughts or floods, ruining crops. Chinese people often asked each other "have you eaten yet?" to ask if they needed food; they were willing to take care of others, even if they themselves had little.

As hunger becomes less of an issue, the phrase is slowly being phased out by the newer generation. However, expressing love through food and caring for others is still very much ingrained in our culture.

"Love" is not a word in Fuzhounese, but the act of love is still shown by actions, and of course, food.
