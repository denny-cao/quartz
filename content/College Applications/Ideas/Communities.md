# Communities
1.  Place: groups of people who live/work/play near one another
2.  Action: groups of people who create change in the world by building, doing, or solving something together (Examples: Black Lives Matter, Girls Who Code, March for Our Lives)
3.  Interest: groups of people coming together based on shared interest, experience, or expertise
4.  Circumstance: groups of people brought together either by chance or external events/situations

- I can talk about my parents encouraging me to explore different areas of interest?
	- I love learning, willing to try everything...
	- Kind of contradictory because if I love learning, why quit?

GRASP Lab:
- Fail fast. This could honestly be where I talk about how I started opening up
- STEM is founded on asking questions?


Parents not enough money to buy me anything. Robot toy. Played with it everyday.

Opportunity to go to GRASP Lab -> holy robots are cool yo

"*Mama*, can I get that?" I pleaded, my finger uncontrollably pointing at the robot toy that imitated the Nao robot.

"No," she sighed. As a child, I was unfamiliar with the concept of money. I didn't know why my parents toiled from day till night at our restaurant, Xin Xing House. I didn't know the struggles they went through, arriving at an unfamiliar country and having to take care of me and my brother. At the time, I only understood that the restaurant was taking away from play time with *mama* and *baba*. 

I reluctantly walked out of Walmart, dragging my feet along while pouting. A month later, I woke up to a knock-off Nao robot on my bedside. I quickly jumped up, racing to my parents’ room to thank them. I was met with an empty room; they had already gone to work. I played by myself, listening to Robo—its new name—sing "beep boop!" As much as I fell in love with Robo, I wished my parents were there.


Robo sparked a desire to learn more about how robots work. Later, through my internship at GRASP Lab, I learned about the future of robotics and the current endeavors and challenges. I want to study and work with robots to create a world where people no longer need to work as hard, a world where parents can spend time with their kids playing with things that go “beep boop!”

- i think this idea has promise... incorporate family = first gen
- possibly could move my cultural essay here?

"Siĕh lō̤ muôi?"—"Have you eaten yet?" in Fuzhounese—is used as a greeting, akin to "How are you?" 

“Why do we do that?” I asked my grandmother in third grade. She told of a past where there was little to eat. Neighbors would ask each other “siĕh lō̤ muôi?” to check up on them, to make sure they were okay. Even if they themselves did not have enough food, they would share it to take care of others. For the same reason, she said, we love Mother Nature. Droughts and floods made it unpredictable whether there would be food or not each year, so people prayed during Chinese New Year in hopes of a good harvest that year. 

My parents have always been strict about not leaving a single grain of rice behind in my bowl after dinner and not using too much water. As a kid, I thought it was just my parents saving money, but as I grew older, I saw it as an appreciation of Mother Nature, not wasting any of her gifts.

To love the Earth, we must protect it by working together to reduce pollution and stop climate change. Loving the Earth also means loving its inhabitants. Whenever someone is struggling, I’ll make sure to ask, “Do you have anything to eat? Have you eaten yet?”

BEEEP! The red Honda angrily screams behind the 42 bus, rudely interrupting Beyoncé singing in my earbuds. A cloud of smoke from the exhaust blows behind us. The bus does not move an inch despite the light turning green, sitting still along with the rest of traffic, bumper to bumper. The tall navy suit man impatiently taps his loafers on the floor, glancing at his watch every few minutes. A lady calls her friend, apologizing that she will be late. I shrug to my friend, Matthew. 

After riding SEPTA my entire life, I’ve become jaded to traffic—I always factor in an extra fifteen to thirty minutes to the time it takes to get somewhere. However, this shouldn’t be the case—the norm. So much time is wasted from sitting around, moving a few inches every few minutes until you reach your destination. At the same time, there is so much fuel being used, so much pollution.

With technology rapidly advancing, why has nothing changed? Traffic lights have made little innovation since its conception in the 1920s. By detecting traffic density, an algorithm could determine the most efficient lights to display for different sides. With AI and computer vision, why can’t Philadelphia and other cities introduce smart traffic lights? Why can’t self-driving cars be used? Accidents, pollution, and traffic would all be reduced.

I finally arrive at my stop—fifteen minutes late. I dream of a future where technology can create a safer, greener, more efficient future where people don’t have to worry about being late.

With my parents constantly working to provide for me, my laptop became my best friend. 

When I was in elementary school, my parents saved up money to buy me a knockoff Nao robot from Walmart. I named it Ro-Bee and played with it alone. I imagine a future where robots make the world a better place, a future where parents can spend time with their kids playing with toys that go “beep boop!” 

MIT is built on *mens et manus*, creating an innovative culture that believes in the application of knowledge. This is evident through the NEET Thread for Autonomous Machines, which lets me apply knowledge from classes in solving real world problems using robotics. It also connects me to internships during the summer and UROPs research. Currently, I am interested in working with Alberto Rodriguez, who tackled the same issue of extrinsic contact sensing as I did during my internship.

language barrier tutoring
- collaborated with kid to translate :o
	- he became my tutor for chinese

brother and i taking care of each other and making weird shit

As I turned the door knob, I was greeted with sounds of kids speaking Mandarin Chinese, laughing and running around. One of them ran up to me, and greeted me—in a language I did not understand. Despite my outward appearance, I was unlike the students in the room. I never learned how to speak Mandarin, yet I was supposed to tutor them in English and math. The puzzled look on my face immediately set off alarms on the students; their tutor didn’t know Chinese! Their unfamiliar language devolved into broken English and silly hand gestures in attempt to communicate with me. 

When I initially talked to the coordinator, she said it would be fine; I thought otherwise.

YES! I exclaimed, clapping my hands triumphantly. Just before summer break, a group of friends and I worked to redesign the website of a community organization, Philadelphia Trail Club. 3 months later, we finished. I scrolled through the website, admiring the smooth parallax scrolling, the reduction of information for simplicity. However, we completely forgot the target audience.

"No," Ash said disappointingly. "Its too confusing to use." When we met with the board PTC to show off our efforts, we were met with constructive feedback.
Our changes obfuscated information, making users have to click to different pages to find important details, scroll through unintuitive page layouts. Good design didn’t just mean how the website looked; it also entitled how accessible it was.

Immediately, we got to work on simplifying the website, intermittently checking in with some of the members to make sure the website was usable for them. While working with senior citizens, we learned about the technological struggles they had to deal with. STEM, as a constantly developing field, is extremely esoteric in nature. I'm proud to have been able to bridge the gap to using tech through design.

Straight li—crooked. Erase. Straight li—crooked. Erase. Straight line. Perfect. I took a step back. Each pencil mark was meticulously etched on the paper, though the result was a far cry from anything remotely considered “art.” I ferociously balled the chicken scratches and tossed them into the trash. Not good enough. 

Maybe it started when I learned about Steve Job's design philosophy of careful thought. Maybe it started at the age of two, when I resolved to put on my pajamas by myself—and consistently failed. I've always held the principle that, if I do anything, I wouldn't "half-ass it". If it was a presentation, I would spend hours worrying about design. Using sans serif and monospace fonts to present data structures in programming club, using red to contrast the beige background for emphasis in my Reconstruction Era presentation. If I didn't understand a concept, I would spend hours going deeper and deeper down the rabit hole to make sense of it; when I was confused about potential energy, even Feynman couldn't save me! Seeking perfection came at a cost.

Maybe it started at the age of two, when I resolved to put on my pajamas by myself—and consistently failed. I've always held the principle that, if I do anything, I wouldn't (excuse my language) "half-ass it." If it was a slide show presentation, I would spend hours worrying about design. Using sans serif and monospace fonts to present data structures in programming club, using red to contrast the beige background for emphasis in my Reconstruction Era presentation. This was no different. 

Picking up drawing again, I felt disappointed by everything I created. Nothing was perfect enough. 

I realized that being perfect was subjective; perfect now would be amature when I got more advanced. Perfect is being able to do the best you can do at your current situation, and the goal should be to learn more and more 

photography--realizing that I


Story about not being able to finish something because I am detail oriented

All my life, I've feared failure, the antithesis for what I strived for. Asking for help would shatter the image of perfection, so I instead opted to learn by myself. I studied hard; kept good grades; smiled at all times—I was “perfect”.

- I want to write about how through failures, I learned perfection was unobtainable, as humans are imperfect unlike machines. 
- Learned to appreciate the progress I’ve made, and to strive for excellence rather than perfection
- Hang up bad art, look back to see progress.
- Maybe end with taking the drawing out of the trash and hanging it up?????
