# Message: Perseverance
## Topic Ideas
- I used to be a quitter, not wanting to do anything I wasn’t good at. Basketball? I quit. Piano? I quit. Later on, I end up regretting not sticking through it. When I ran hurdles for the first time last year, I tripped at the second to last hurdle. I got up, and went through the last hurdle to finish the race.
- Kelly Drive runs to eventually reach a mile
- Learning how to ride a bike at 17 while elementary school kids are popping wheelies
- Music helps me, whether its the all nighter I’m pulling for a project or the grueling run to prepare for the marathon. Music is my best friend. 
- Parents’ restaurant and immigrant experience → Me

# Message: Self-Improvement/Confidence
## Topic Ideas
- I’m afraid to ask for help. STEM: Questions are the key to understanding → Learning to ask for help.
- I hate photos of me. I volunteer to take group photos instead → Delegated photographer. Looking back in my camera roll, there was barely any photos of me besides the few my parents have of me trying to hide my face. I decided to change that.
- I’m afraid of being wrong—afraid of failure; I don’t raise my hand unless I absolutely am sure of the answer
- While practicing the typical song every beginner tries to play on the piano, Fur Elise, for my elementary school talent show, I couldn’t play the B section at measure 22, the second ending of the repeat. I became frustrated and just practiced the easy part I knew over and over and Ms. Eby, my elementary school music teacher, told me that I would never get better or even learn the song if I just do the easy stuff
- First times speaking in front of a large group of people: Elementary school graduation or middle school treasurer campaign speech
- Keratosis pilaris skin condition 
- The day I stopped reading
