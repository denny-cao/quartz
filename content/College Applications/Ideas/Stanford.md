Here’s what Stanford offers that nobody else offers:

1.  The college that Tiger Woods graduated from
2.  Hiking trails to “The Dish” right on campus
3.  Venture capital firms on Sand Hill Road are on Stanford’s land
4.  The Herbert Hoover museum

Here’s what Stanford offers that very few colleges offer:

1.  Their own golf course and riding stables.
2.  Their own shopping center with upscale retail stores where students generally can’t afford to shop
3.  Proximity to Silicon Valley with their plethora of startup firms and venture capital funding for entrepreneurs
4.  Very rigid bureaucracy that won’t make exceptions to their iron-clad rules

One is SLAC, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, a 2 mile long linear accelerator for the study of elemental particle physics. Other things are the iconic aspects of Stanford architecture and buildings like “Mem Chu” (Memorial Church), the iconic view of Mem Chu as you enter Stanford on Palm Drive, “The Claw” (The fountain in White Plaza), Hoover Tower, the Rodin Statues, The Quad, Lake Lagunita, The “Dish” which is the radio telescope on the Stanford Campus.

One feature that probably only Stanford alumni and students know about are the brass plaques marking each graduating class that are laid consecutively on the covered walkway surrounding the Quad. Under each brass plaque is a time capsule holding items chosen by the graduating class to be interned in perpetuity.

“Each year's graduating class buries a time capsule and marks it with a plaque in the walkway around Inner Quad, starting with the class of 1896”
the seemingly mundane items Stanford seniors leave in their class time capsule hold treasured personal meaning and memories.
