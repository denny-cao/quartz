**Optional short answer: Imagine your future. How will you utilize the resources and opportunities available at Case Western Reserve University to realize that future?**
- Hacker's Society
- Co-ops
- Collaborative environment
- We also got amazing AI related classes (thanks to Ray), and we are having more "flavored" AI classes like algo fairness, NLP, computational perceptions, etc. The last field seems to suit your interests well and we have Lewicki (published on Nature) for it — might want to talk to him if you decide to come.
- Veale club sports
- Elephant Steps
- Andy Podgurski is my favorite CS professor you will learn a lot from each of his classes. Honorable Mentions: Swarup Bhunia, Vichenzo Liberatore, and GQ Zhang (Take his Theoretical CS as early as you can)
- Rush which is the first two weeks of classes
- “Think beyond the possible” is more than a motto at Case Western Reserve. It exemplifies our approach, and obligation, as an institution of higher learning. Every day, we strive to improve people’s lives through preeminent research, education and creative endeavor.
