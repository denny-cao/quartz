- Dad cheering me on, laughing proud of my successes. Calling Mom, Mom cheering me on while worrying that I might still be on the road
- Dad learning how to drive story; stolen imported cars, no one to teach, made small turns on the wheel
Buds:
- Drive w/Dad. Looking forward to drives with friends, traveling, making new memories
- Long Le response email! Looking forward to potentially starting research w/Lifelong Learning Group. Apply to D.E. Shaw, 2Sig winter internship, etc. [[Articulate Anything]]
Thorns:
